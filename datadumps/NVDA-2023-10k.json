        "Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.",
        "As of January 29, 2023, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5,159 million and the Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations balance was $4,920 million, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.",
        "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
        "This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
        "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
        "These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",

        "Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year.ReclassificationsCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.Prior period intangible asset gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization in Note 7 have been adjusted to write off immaterial fully amortized intangible assets as of January 30, 2022.Principles of ConsolidationOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.",
        "All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.",
        "GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.",
        "Actual results could differ materially from our estimates.",
        "On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies.",
        "The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19.",
        "These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.In February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment.",
        "Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five to seven years.",
        "This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024.",
        "Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net in use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $133 million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense.",
        "Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services.",
        "We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products.",
        "Certain products are 59Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software.",
        "Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.",
        "Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.",
        "However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.",
        "We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components.",
        "As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed.",
        "We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.",
        "If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.Software LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer.",
        "Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.",
        "Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades.",
        "Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer.",
        "Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Cloud ServicesCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage.",
        "Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs.",
        "Product WarrantiesWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures.",
        "Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition.",
        "Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products.",
        "We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.Stock-based CompensationWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs.",
        "We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs.",
        "The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line 60Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model.",
        "We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year.",
        "Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model.",
        "Additionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Litigation, Investigation and Settlement CostsWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.",
        "There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments.",
        "If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S.",
        "GAAP.",
        "However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.Foreign Currency RemeasurementWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries.",
        "Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates.",
        "Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.",
        "Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates.",
        "Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.Income TaxesWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction.",
        "We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.",
        "Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances.",
        "In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due.",
        "If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As of January 29, 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.48 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, state, and certain other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes.",
        "To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.61Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position.",
        "Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Net Income Per ShareBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.",
        "Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method.",
        "Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive.",
        "Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.",
        "Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased.",
        "We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale.",
        "These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax.",
        "The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest.",
        "Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.Available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review.",
        "If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis.",
        "Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022.",
        "Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax.",
        "Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value.",
        "The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.",
        "For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged.",
        "For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings.",
        "For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable.",
        "Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration.",
        "We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses.",
        "This allowance consists of an amount 62Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure.",
        "Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.InventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis.",
        "Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts.",
        "We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments.",
        "Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.",
        "Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up.",
        "We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost.",
        "Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years.",
        "Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded.",
        "The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases.",
        "Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.LeasesWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception.",
        "Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.",
        "Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate.",
        "Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives.",
        "Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.",
        "Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist.",
        "For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.",
        "Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units.",
        "The quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value.",
        "The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.",
        "63Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP.",
        "We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.",
        "We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life.",
        "When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.",
        "Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group.",
        "If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group.",

        "According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $17 million.As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding.",
        "We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

        "Foreign Exchange Rate RiskWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as our sales are in United States dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange rate movements.",

        "The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations.",
        "Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete.",
        "Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us.",
        "Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar.",

        "We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis.",
        "Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S.",

        "federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.",
        "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
        "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.",
        "Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.",
        "We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
        "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 52Table of Contentsdirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
        "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
        "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase CommitmentsAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments.",
        "Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.",
        "As of January 29, 2023, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5,159 million and the Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations balance was $4,920 million, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.",
        "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
        "This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
        "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
        "These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
        "Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaFebruary 24, 2023We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004.",

        "Actual results could differ materially from our estimates.",
        "On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies.",
        "The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19.",
        "These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.In February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment.",
        "Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five to seven years.",
        "This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024.",
        "Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net in use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $133 million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense.",
        "Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services.",
        "We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products.",
        "Certain products are 59Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software.",
        "Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.",
        "Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.",
        "However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.",
        "We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components.",
        "As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed.",
        "We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.",
        "If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.Software LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer.",
        "Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.",
        "Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades.",
        "Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer.",
        "Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Cloud ServicesCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage.",
        "Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs.",
        "Product WarrantiesWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures.",
        "Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition.",
        "Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products.",
        "We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.Stock-based CompensationWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs.",
        "We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs.",
        "The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line 60Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model.",
        "We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year.",
        "Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model.",
        "Additionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Litigation, Investigation and Settlement CostsWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.",
        "There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments.",
        "If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S.",
        "GAAP.",
        "However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.Foreign Currency RemeasurementWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries.",

        "We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 29, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.",
        "Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.",
        "Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.",
        "We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.",
        "federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.",
        "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
        "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.",
        "Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.",
        "We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
        "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 52Table of Contentsdirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
        "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
        "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase CommitmentsAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments.",
        "Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.",
        "As of January 29, 2023, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5,159 million and the Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply obligations balance was $4,920 million, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.",
        "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
        "This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
        "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
        "These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
        "Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaFebruary 24, 2023We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004.",

        "Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year.ReclassificationsCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.Prior period intangible asset gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization in Note 7 have been adjusted to write off immaterial fully amortized intangible assets as of January 30, 2022.Principles of ConsolidationOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.",
        "All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.",
        "GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.",
        "Actual results could differ materially from our estimates.",
        "On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies.",
        "The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19.",
        "These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.In February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment.",
        "Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five to seven years.",
        "This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2024.",
        "Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net in use as of the end of fiscal year 2023, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2024 operating income by $133 million as a result of the reduction in depreciation expense.",
        "Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services.",
        "We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products.",
        "Certain products are 59Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software.",
        "Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.",
        "Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.",
        "However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.",
        "We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components.",
        "As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed.",
        "We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.",
        "If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.Software LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer.",
        "Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.",
        "Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades.",
        "Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer.",
        "Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Cloud ServicesCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage.",
        "Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs.",
        "Product WarrantiesWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures.",
        "Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition.",
        "Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products.",
        "We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.Stock-based CompensationWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs.",
        "We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs.",
        "The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line 60Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model.",
        "We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year.",
        "Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model.",
        "Additionally, we estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Litigation, Investigation and Settlement CostsWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.",
        "There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments.",
        "If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S.",
        "GAAP.",
        "However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.Foreign Currency RemeasurementWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries.",
        "Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates.",
        "Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.",
        "Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates.",
        "Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.Income TaxesWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction.",
        "We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.",
        "Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances.",
        "In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due.",
