        "We believe our advertising investments and other demand generation efforts during the past 18 months have successfully elevated awareness and consideration for our brands, leading to record booking levels and revenue results.",
        "In addition, these efforts enabled us to attract more new-to cruise and more new-to brand guests compared to 2019.",
        "We are building momentum in closing the value gap to land-based alternatives, capturing over 3.5 million new-to cruise guests in 2023 and remain well-positioned to take share from land-based alternatives.",
        "We continue to take actions to further stimulate demand and maintain our momentum through 2024 and beyond.",
        "We are focused on ongoing improvements across the commercial space as we further rollout advancements to our yield management tools and lead generation techniques, continue to invest in sales and sales support, and build on already strong relationships with our trade partners.",
        "This is complemented by our strategy to pull forward the sale of onboard items through bundled product offerings and pre-cruise sales.",
        "We are also not losing sight of our expense base, as we have worked to mitigate the impacts of a high inflation environment by leveraging our scale through cost optimization initiatives.",
        "We have made investments that we expect to increase our cost efficiencies in the future, including successfully installing SpaceX's Starlink, next generation internet across our fleet, which is expected to drive more than a 20% reduction in cost per megabit in 2024.",
        "In addition, we expect it will increase our bandwidth pipeline, resulting in both improved guest experience and higher onboard revenues.",
        "We also launched Maritime Asset Strategy Transformation (“MAST”), a centralized system developed to optimize equipment and machinery management across our brands and our fleet.During 2023, we continued to work aggressively to reduce our environmental footprint and fuel consumption.",
        "Our deep commitment resulted in industry-leading fuel efficiency and a more than 10% reduction in absolute GHG emissions compared to our peak year of 2011, despite capacity growth of 30% over the same period.",
        "We also exceeded our shore power capability goal and our fleet now has twice as many ships ready to plug into shore power as there are ports currently able to provide it.",
        "As a result of our fleet optimization efforts, our fleet is now one year younger than prior to pausing our guest cruise operations four years ago.",
        "During 2023 alone we benefited from the introduction of three fantastic new ships including Carnival Celebration and Arvia, leveraging the scale of our popular and exceptionally efficient series of excel-class ships, and Seabourn Pursuit, our second luxury expedition ship.",

        "In addition, we commenced work with our Grand Bahama Shipyard partners on the construction of two floating docks, one of which will have the largest lifting capacity in the world.",
        "Together, these strategic investments are expected to significantly benefit us by helping to reduce travel time, further reducing our fuel consumption and preserving ship revenue days.Our significantly improved 2023 cash from operations enabled us to notably reduce the substantial debt balance incurred during the pause of guest cruise operations.",
        "In 2023, we made sizeable debt prepayments and ended the year with over $5 billion of liquidity.",
        "Looking forward, we expect to continue to strategically refinance and prepay debt, leveraging our improving operating cash flow and the return of substantially all of the remaining credit card reserves during the first quarter of 2024.",
        "48In addition, with nearly two-thirds of 2024 on the books already, we are well positioned to achieve another year of record revenues.",
        "This, combined with excess liquidity, is expected to enable us to continue actively managing down debt and reducing interest expense, leaving us on our path back to achieving investment grade credit ratings and higher return on invested capital.This has been a truly remarkable year, and we have come a long way in an incredibly short amount of time.",
        "We delivered unforgettable happiness to over 12 million guests this year and look forward to continuing to provide our guests with extraordinary cruise vacations in 2024, while honoring the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visit and life we touch.",
        "New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to our consolidated financial statements for further information on Accounting Pronouncements.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur critical accounting estimates are those we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.",
        "A discussion of our critical accounting estimates, the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows: Liquidity and Other UncertaintiesWe make several critical accounting estimates with respect to our liquidity.As part of our liquidity management, we rely on estimates of our future liquidity, which includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.",
        "The principal assumptions used to estimate our future liquidity consist of: •Expected increases in revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023•Expected prepayment of debt•Continued stabilization of inflationary pressures on costs compared to 2023•Fuel prices at or around November 2023 year-end pricesIn addition, we make certain assumptions about new ship deliveries, improvements on existing ships as well as other capital expenditures, removals of existing ships, and consider the future export credit financings that are associated with the new ship deliveries.We have a substantial debt balance incurred during the pause in guest cruise operations and require a significant amount of liquidity or cash provided by operating activities to service our debt.",
        "We will continue to pursue various opportunities to refinance future debt maturities to extend maturity dates and reduce interest expense by repaying some of our existing indebtedness.Ship Accounting We make several critical accounting estimates with respect to our ship accounting including ship improvement costs, estimated useful lives and residual values.We account for ship improvement costs, including replacements of certain significant components and parts, by capitalizing those costs that we believe add value to our ships and have a useful life greater than one year and depreciating those improvements over their estimated remaining useful life.",
        "The costs of repairs and maintenance, including those incurred when a ship is taken out-of-service for scheduled maintenance, and minor improvement costs and expenses, are charged to expense as incurred.",
        "If we change our assumptions in making our determinations as to whether improvements to a ship add value, the amounts we expense each year as repair and maintenance expense could increase, which would be partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense, resulting from a reduction in capitalized costs.In addition, the specifically identified or estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of previously capitalized ship components are written-off upon retirement, which may result in a loss on disposal that is also included in other operating expenses.",
        "We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ships.",
        "In addition, since we do not separately componentize our ships, we do not identify and track depreciation of original ship components.",
        "Therefore, we typically have to estimate the net book value of components that are retired, based primarily upon their replacement cost, their age and their original estimated useful lives.",
        "Given the large size and complexity of our ships, ship accounting estimates require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain.",
        "49In order to compute our ships’ depreciation expense, we apply judgment to determine their useful lives as well as their residual values.",
        "We have estimated our ships’ useful lives at 30 years and residual values at 15% of our original ship cost.",
        "Our ships’ useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the estimated weighted-average useful lives of the ships’ major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins.",
        "We also take into consideration the impact of technological changes, historical useful lives of similarly-built ships, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and regulatory changes, including those related to the environment and climate change.",
        "We determine the residual value of our ships based on our long-term estimates of their resale value at the end of their useful lives to us but before the end of their physical and economic lives to others, historical resale values of our and other cruise ships as well as our expectations of the long-term viability of the secondary cruise ship market.",
        "We review estimated useful lives and residual values for reasonableness whenever events or circumstances significantly change.",
        "Since the pause of our guest cruise operations, we have disposed of ships for amounts significantly below their book values.",
        "Management has estimated that this trend will normalize in the coming years.The IMO recently adopted its 2023 Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships that would require international shipping to reduce total GHG emissions on a well-to-wake basis to net zero by or around 2050.",
        "In addition, the framework introduces checkpoints in 2030 and 2040 that seek reductions in the total GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 20% and 70%, respectively, compared to 2008.",
        "The EU has also proposed several regulations that will likely impact the cost of fossil fuels and has recently adopted the inclusion of maritime shipping in the EU’s Emission Trading System.",
        "We have established Climate Action Goals, which include a GHG intensity reduction goal of 20% by 2030 from the 2019 baseline and pursuing net zero emissions by 2050.",
        "Given a 30-year estimated useful life for our ships, our most recently delivered vessels’ lives will extend beyond this 2050 date.",
        "Fossil fuels are currently the only viable option for our industry and it is not clear when alternative fuels or other technologies will be commercially viable.",
        "To provide a path to net zero emissions, alternative low GHG emission fuels will be necessary for the maritime industry; however, there are significant supply challenges that must be resolved before viability is reached.",
        "We are closely monitoring technology developments and partnering with key organizations on research and development to support our sustainability goals and aspirations.",
        "Our fleet’s engines are capable of being modified for use with certain alternative fuels and we have completed tests on the use of marine biofuel blends on certain ships in our fleet.",
        "In addition, and in support of our Climate Action Goals, we invest in technologies, including the use of LNG powered cruise ships, the installation of Advanced Air Quality Systems on board our ships to aid in the reduction of sulfur emissions, the use of shore power, enabling ships to use shoreside electric power where available while in port and various other efficiency related upgrades intended to reduce our emissions.",
        "It is uncertain how recently adopted, proposed and possible future regulatory changes related to the environment and climate change and our pursuit of net zero emissions by 2050, may impact our ships’ useful lives and residual values and the impact is dependent on future regulatory actions and technological advances.",
        "As of November 30, 2023, management concluded that there were no changes in our ship useful lives and residual value estimates.If materially different conditions existed, or if we materially changed our assumptions of ship useful lives and residual values, then our depreciation expense, loss on retirement of ship components and net book value of our ships would be materially different.",
        "Our 2023 ship depreciation expense would have increased by approximately:•$49 million assuming we had reduced our estimated 30-year ship useful life estimate by one year at the time we took delivery or acquired each of our ships•$245 million assuming we had estimated our ships to have no residual valueWe believe that the estimates we made for ship accounting purposes are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied in all material respects and result in depreciation expense that is based on a rational and systematic method to equitably allocate the costs of our ships to the periods during which we use them.",
        "Valuation of ShipsImpairment reviews of our ships require us to make significant estimates.",
        "We evaluate ship asset impairments at the individual ship level which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.",
        "We review our ships for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a ship may not be recoverable.",
        "If estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of a ship, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.",
        "Where estimated future cash flows are used to estimate the recoverable value of a ship, the cash flows include estimated regulatory costs, including those related to proposed regulations, which are likely to impact costs and capital expenditures, including those expected to meet our 2030 Climate Action Goals.The estimation of a ship’s fair value includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.",
        "The principal assumption used in determining the fair value of these ships was the estimated sales proceeds.We determined the fair value of these ships based on their respective estimated selling values, for those ships expected to be disposed of, or estimated discounted future cash flows and comparable market transactions.",
        "Refer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our property and equipment policy and ship impairment reviews. 50We believe that we have made reasonable estimates.",
        "ContingenciesWe periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us, as well as for other known unasserted claims, including environmental, legal, regulatory and guest and crew matters.",
        "While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these matters, we use our best judgment to determine the appropriate amounts to record in our consolidated financial statements.",
        "We accrue a liability and establish a reserve when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.",
        "In assessing probable losses, we make estimates of the amount of probable insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets where appropriate.",
        "Such accruals and reserves are typically based on developments to date, management’s estimates of the outcomes of these matters, our experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar matters, historical claims experience, actuarially determined estimates of liabilities and any related insurance coverage.",
        "Given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of these matters and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we may have made.",
        "In addition, as new information becomes available, we may need to reassess the amount of asset or liability that needs to be accrued related to our contingencies.",
        "All such changes in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.Refer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of contingencies.Known Trends and Uncertainties•We believe the volatility in the cost of fuel and increases in other related costs are reasonably likely to continue to impact our profitability in both the short and long-term.",
        "•We believe inflation and interest rates are reasonably likely to continue to impact our profitability.",
        "•We believe a global minimum tax could affect us in 2026, with the potential for a one-year deferral.",
        "Prior to any mitigating actions, we believe the annual impact could be approximately $200 million.",
        "We continue to evaluate the impact of these rules and are currently evaluating a variety of mitigating actions to minimize the impact.",
        "The application of the rules continues to evolve, and its outcome may alter our tax obligations in certain countries in which we operate.•We believe the increasing global focus on climate change, including the reduction of GHG emissions and new and evolving regulatory requirements, is reasonably likely to have a material negative impact on our future financial results.",
        "We became subject to the EU Emission Trading Scheme (“ETS”) on January 1, 2024, which includes a three-year phase-in period.",

        "Together with their consolidated subsidiaries, they are referred to collectively in these consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this 2023 Annual Report as “Carnival Corporation & plc,” “our,” “us” and “we.” The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc and their respective subsidiaries.",
        "We are the largest global cruise company, and among the largest leisure travel companies, with a portfolio of world-class cruise lines – AIDA Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises (Australia), P&O Cruises (UK), Princess Cruises, and Seabourn.DLC Arrangement Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc operate a dual listed company (“DLC”) arrangement, whereby the businesses of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are combined through a number of contracts and provisions in Carnival Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and Carnival plc’s Articles of Association.",
        "The two companies operate as a single economic enterprise with a single senior management team and identical Boards of Directors, but each has retained its separate legal identity.",
        "Each company’s shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) for Carnival Corporation and the London Stock Exchange for Carnival plc.",
        "The Carnival plc American Depositary Shares are traded on the NYSE.",
        "The constitutional documents of each company provide that, on most matters, the holders of the common equity of both companies effectively vote as a single body.",
        "The Equalization and Governance Agreement between Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc provides for the equalization of dividends and liquidation distributions based on an equalization ratio and contains provisions relating to the governance of the DLC arrangement.",
        "Because the equalization ratio is 1 to 1, one share of Carnival Corporation common stock and one Carnival plc ordinary share are generally entitled to the same distributions.Under deeds of guarantee executed in connection with the DLC arrangement, as well as stand-alone guarantees executed since that time, each of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc have effectively cross guaranteed all indebtedness and certain other monetary obligations of each other.",
        "Once the written demand is made, the holders of indebtedness or other obligations may immediately commence an action against the relevant guarantor.Under the terms of the DLC arrangement, Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are permitted to transfer assets between the companies, make loans to or investments in each other and otherwise enter into intercompany transactions.",
        "In addition, the cash flows and assets of one company are required to be used to pay the obligations of the other company, if necessary.",
        "Given the DLC arrangement, we believe that providing separate financial statements for each of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc would not present a true and fair view of the economic realities of their operations.",
        "Accordingly, separate financial statements for Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc have not been presented.",
        "NOTE 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of PresentationWe consolidate entities over which we have control, as typically evidenced by a voting control of greater than 50% or for which we are the primary beneficiary, whereby we have the power to direct the most significant activities and the obligation to absorb significant losses or receive significant benefits from the entity.",
        "We do not separately present our noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements since the amounts are immaterial.",
        "For affiliates we do not control but where significant influence over financial and operating policies exists, as typically evidenced by a voting control of 20% to 50%, the investment is accounted for using the equity method.68Preparation of Financial StatementsThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.",
        "GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.",
        "The full extent to which the effects of inflation, higher fuel prices, higher taxes, higher interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency rates will directly or indirectly impact our business, operations, results of operations and financial condition, including our valuation of goodwill and trademarks, impairment of ships and collectability of trade and notes receivables, will depend on future developments that are uncertain.",
        "We have made reasonable estimates and judgments of such items within our financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods.",
        "Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.",
        "All material intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include investments with maturities of three months or less at acquisition which are stated at cost and present insignificant risk of changes in value.",
        "Restricted Cash We consider cash to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted.",
        "Restricted cash is classified as current or non-current based on the expected timing of our ability to access or use the amounts. The non-current portion is included within other assets.",
        "Trade and Other Receivables Although we generally require full payment from our customers prior to or concurrently with their cruise, we grant credit terms to a relatively small portion of our revenue source.",
        "We have receivables from credit card merchants and travel agents for cruise ticket purchases and onboard revenue.",
        "These receivables are included within trade and other receivables, net and are less allowances for expected credit losses.",
        "We have agreements with a number of credit card processors that transact customer deposits related to our cruise vacations.",
        "Certain of these agreements allow the credit card processors to request, under certain circumstances, that we provide a reserve fund in cash.",
        "These reserve funds are included in other assets.InventoriesInventories consist substantially of food, beverages, hotel supplies, fuel and retail merchandise, which are all carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value.",
        "Cost is determined using the weighted-average or first-in, first-out methods and applied consistently between major categories of inventory.",
        "Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment charges. We capitalize interest as part of the cost of capital projects incurred during construction.",
        "Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over our estimated useful lives of the assets to a residual value, as a percentage of original cost, as follows:YearsResidualValuesShips3015%Ship improvements3-300%Buildings and improvements10-400%Computer hardware and software2-120%Transportation equipment and other3-200%Leasehold improvements, including port facilitiesShorter of the remaining lease term or related asset life (3-30)0%The cost of ships under construction includes progress payments for the construction of new ships, as well as design and engineering fees, capitalized interest, construction oversight costs and various owner supplied items.",
        "Any liquidated damages received from shipyards are recorded as reductions to the cost basis of the ship.",
        "69We have a capital program for the improvement of our ships and for asset replacements to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations; to comply with, or exceed, all relevant legal and statutory requirements related to health, environment, safety, security and sustainability; and to gain strategic benefits or provide improved product innovations to our guests.",
        "We account for ship improvement costs, including replacements of certain significant components and parts, by capitalizing those costs we believe add value to our ships and have a useful life greater than one year and depreciating those improvements over their estimated remaining useful life.",
        "The costs of repairs and maintenance, including those incurred when a ship is taken out-of-service for scheduled maintenance, and minor improvement costs and expenses, are charged to expense as incurred.In addition, specifically identified or estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of previously capitalized ship components are written-off upon retirement, which may result in a loss on disposal that is also included in other operating expenses.We have estimated our ships’ useful lives at 30 years and residual values at 15% of our original ship cost.",
        "Our ships’ useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the estimated weighted-average useful lives of the ships’ major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins.",
        "We also take into consideration the impact of technological changes, historical useful lives of similarly-built ships, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and regulatory changes, including those related to the environment and climate change.",
        "We determine the residual value of our ships based on our long-term estimates of their resale value at the end of their useful lives to us but before the end of their physical and economic lives to others, historical resale values of our and other cruise ships as well as our expectations of the long-term viability of the secondary cruise ship market.",
        "We review estimated useful lives and residual values for reasonableness whenever events or circumstances significantly change.We evaluate ship asset impairments at the individual ship level which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.",
        "We review our ships for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a ship may not be recoverable.",
        "If estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of a ship, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.",
        "LeasesSubstantially all of our leases for which we are the lessee are operating leases of port facilities and real estate and are included within operating lease right-of-use assets, long-term operating lease liabilities and current portion of operating lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.We have port facilities and real estate lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and in such cases, we account for the components as a single lease component.We do not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for any leases with an original term of less than one year.",
        "For some of our port facilities and real estate lease agreements, we have the option to extend our current lease term by 1 to 10 years.",
        "Generally, we do not include renewal options as a component of our present value calculation as we are not reasonably certain that we will exercise the options.As most of our leases do not have a readily determinable implicit rate, we estimate the incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) to determine the present value of lease payments.",
        "We apply judgment in estimating the IBR including considering the term of the lease, the currency in which the lease is denominated, and the impact of collateral and our credit risk on the rate.We amortize our lease assets on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Goodwill and Other IntangiblesGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business acquisition.",
        "We review our goodwill for impairment as of July 31 every year, or more frequently if events or circumstances dictate. All of our goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units.",
        "The impairment review for goodwill allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative goodwill impairment test.",
        "We would perform the quantitative test if our qualitative assessment determined it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount.",
        "We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting unit.",
        "When performing the quantitative test, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis is required.",
        "However, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, goodwill is written down based on the difference between the reporting unit’s carrying 70amount and its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.",
        "Judgment is required in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit.Trademarks represent substantially all of our other intangibles.",
        "Trademarks are estimated to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortizable but are reviewed for impairment at least annually and as events or circumstances dictate.",
        "The impairment review for trademarks also allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative trademark impairment test.",
        "We would perform the quantitative test if our qualitative assessment determined it was more-likely-than-not that the trademarks are impaired.",
        "We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test. Our trademarks would be considered impaired if their carrying value exceeds their estimated fair value.",
        "Equity Method Investments Equity method investments are initially recognized at cost and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.",
        "Our proportionate interest in their results is included in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).Debt and Debt Issuance CostsDebt is recorded at initial fair value, which normally reflects the proceeds received by us, net of debt issuance costs.",
        "Debt is subsequently stated at amortized cost.",
        "Debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums are generally amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the debt.Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments We have in the past and may in the future utilize derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency forwards, options and swaps, foreign currency debt obligations and foreign currency cash balances, to manage our exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates.",
        "We use interest rate swaps primarily to manage our interest rate exposure to achieve a desired proportion of fixed and floating rate debt.",
        "Our policy is to not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. All derivatives are recorded at fair value.",
        "If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, then the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of AOCI until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings or the forecasted transaction is no longer probable.",
        "If a derivative or a non-derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of our net investment in a foreign operation, then changes in the effective portion of the fair value of the financial instrument are recognized as a component of AOCI to offset the change in the translated value of the designated portion of net investment being hedged until the investment is sold or substantially liquidated, while the impact attributable to components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recorded in interest expense, net of capitalized interest, on a systematic and rational basis.",
        "For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the change in fair value is recognized in earnings.",
        "We classify the fair value of all our derivative contracts as either current or long-term, depending on the maturity date of the derivative contract.",
        "The cash flows from derivatives treated as cash flow hedges are classified in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same category as the item being hedged.",
        "Derivative valuations are based on observable inputs such as interest rates and commodity price curves, forward currency exchange rates, credit spreads, maturity dates, volatilities, and cross currency basis spreads.",
        "We use the income approach to value derivatives for foreign currency options and forwards, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps using observable market data for all significant inputs and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount, assuming that participants are motivated but not compelled to transact.Foreign Currency Translation and TransactionsThese financial statements are presented in U.S.",
        "dollars. Each foreign entity determines its functional currency by reference to its primary economic environment. Our most significant foreign entities utilize the U.S.",
        "dollar, Euro, Sterling or the Australian dollar as their functional currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign entities that have functional currencies other than the U.S.",
        "dollar at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses of these foreign entities are translated at the average rate for the period.",
        "Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of AOCI, which is a separate component of shareholders’ equity. 71Therefore, the U.S.",
        "dollar value of the non-equity translated items in our consolidated financial statements will fluctuate from period to period, depending on the changing value of the U.S. dollar versus these currencies.",
        "We execute transactions in a number of different currencies.",
        "At the date that the transaction is recognized, each asset, liability, revenue, expense, gain or loss arising from the transaction is measured and recorded in the functional currency of the recording entity using the exchange rate in effect at that date.",
        "At each balance sheet date, recorded monetary balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are adjusted using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date, with gains or losses recorded in other income or other expense, unless such monetary balances have been designated as hedges of net investments in our foreign entities.",
        "The net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were not material in 2023, 2022 and 2021.",
        "In addition, the unrealized gains or losses on our long-term intercompany receivables and payables which are denominated in a non-functional currency and which are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments included as a component of AOCI.",
        "Revenue and Expense Recognition Guest cruise deposits and advance onboard purchases are initially included in customer deposits when received.",
        "Customer deposits are subsequently recognized as cruise revenues, together with revenues from onboard and other activities, and all associated direct costs and expenses of a voyage are recognized as cruise costs and expenses, upon completion of voyages with durations of ten nights or less and on a pro rata basis for voyages in excess of ten nights.",
        "The impact of recognizing these shorter duration cruise revenues and costs and expenses on a completed voyage basis versus on a pro rata basis is not material.",
        "Certain of our product offerings are bundled and we allocate the value of the bundled services and goods between passenger ticket revenues and onboard and other revenues based upon the estimated standalone selling prices of those goods and services.",
        "Guest cancellation fees, when applicable, are recognized in passenger ticket revenues at the time of cancellation.",
        "Our sales to guests of air and other transportation to and from airports near the home ports of our ships are included in passenger ticket revenues, and the related costs of purchasing these services are included in transportation costs.",
        "The proceeds that we collect from the sales of third-party shore excursions are included in onboard and other revenues and the related costs are included in onboard and other costs.",
        "The amounts collected on behalf of our onboard concessionaires, net of the amounts remitted to them, are included in onboard and other revenues as concession revenues.",
        "All of these amounts are recognized on a completed voyage or pro rata basis as discussed above. Passenger ticket revenues include fees, taxes and charges collected by us from our guests.",
        "The fees, taxes and charges that vary with guest head counts and are directly imposed on a revenue-producing arrangement are expensed in commissions, transportation and other costs when the corresponding revenues are recognized.",
        "These fees, taxes and charges included in commissions, transportation and other costs were $730 million in 2023, $438 million in 2022 and $73 million in 2021.",
        "The remaining portion of fees, taxes and charges are expensed in other operating expenses when the corresponding revenues are recognized.Revenues and expenses from our hotel and transportation operations, which are included in our Tour and Other segment, are recognized at the time the services are performed.Customer DepositsOur payment terms generally require an initial deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to the voyage.",
        "Cash received from guests in advance of the cruise is recorded in customer deposits and in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts include refundable deposits.",
        "In certain situations, we have provided flexibility to guests by allowing guests to rebook at a future date, receive future cruise credits (“FCCs”) or elect to receive refunds in cash.",
        "We have at times issued enhanced FCCs.",

        "If our sustainability practices do not meet, or are perceived to fall short of, the expectations of our guests, team members, investors or other stakeholders, demand for cruising, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain team members, and our attractiveness as an investment could be negatively impacted.",

        "Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue, meet or fulfill our targets, goals, aspirations, and other objectives (including sustainability objectives) within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have the same negative impacts as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.",

        "Breach or circumvention of our 40systems or the systems of third parties, including by ransomware or malware, through vulnerabilities in licensed software or hardware, or as a result of other attacks, has led to and may continue to lead to disruptions in our business operations; unauthorized access to (or the loss of company access to) competitively sensitive, confidential or other critical data (including sensitive financial, medical or other personal or business information) or systems; loss of customers; financial losses; regulatory investigations, enforcement actions and fines; litigation; reputational damage; and misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, any of which could be material.",

        "We may not be successful in recruiting, developing or retaining key or other highly qualified team members. In addition, high-GHG emission industries may become a less attractive employment opportunity.",
        "At times we have and may in the future experience difficulty in hiring sufficient qualified team members, due to general macroeconomic factors and/or increasingly competitive labor markets.In addition, we hire a significant number of qualified shipboard team members each year and, thus, our ability to adequately recruit, develop and retain these individuals is critical to our success.",
        "Incidents involving cruise ships, including disease outbreaks on our ships and increasing demand as a result of the industry’s projected growth could negatively impact our ability to recruit, develop and retain sufficient qualified shipboard team members.i.",

        "The supply and availability of different fuel types in various markets in which we operate have experienced increased volatility and have led to increased fuel prices and reduced profitability.",

        "Increases in airfares, such as those resulting from increases in the price of fuel, would increase our guests’ overall vacation costs and could reduce demand for cruises, as many of our guests depend on airlines to transport them to or from the airports near the ports where our cruises embark and disembark.",

        "Events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us, including labor actions, increased demand, problems in production or distribution and/or disruptions in third-party logistics, information technology or transportation systems.",
        "In addition, global events in recent years have resulted in widespread global supply chain disruptions to vendors including critical supply chain shortages, labor shortages, significant material cost inflation and extended lead times for items that are required for our operations.",

        "We face competition from other cruise brands on the basis of overall experience, destinations, types and sizes of ships and cabins, travel agent partner preferences and value.",
        "We also compete with land-based vacation alternatives throughout the world on the basis of overall experience, destinations and value.",
        "In addition, certain ports and destinations have faced a surge of both cruise and non-cruise tourism and in certain destinations, countermeasures to limit the number of tourists have been contemplated and/or put into effect, including proposed limits on cruise ships and cruise guests.",

        "2023 Executive OverviewWe consistently set records and achieved other significant milestones during this past year, including:•Full year revenues hit an all-time high of $21.6 billion.•For the first time since the resumption of guest cruise operations, net income was positive during the third quarter, generating $1.07 billion.•We entered 2024 with our best booked position on record, for both price and occupancy.•Total customer deposits for each quarter throughout 2023 consistently surpassed the previous quarterly records.•We reduced our debt balance by $4.6 billion from its peak in the first quarter of 2023 and ended the year with $5.4 billion of liquidity.The strengthening demand environment across all our brands contributed to our revenue growth as we drove improvements in ticket prices while closing the double-digit occupancy gap from the start of the year and reaching historical occupancy levels for the second half of 2023.",
        "We believe our advertising investments and other demand generation efforts during the past 18 months have successfully elevated awareness and consideration for our brands, leading to record booking levels and revenue results.",
        "In addition, these efforts enabled us to attract more new-to cruise and more new-to brand guests compared to 2019.",
        "We are building momentum in closing the value gap to land-based alternatives, capturing over 3.5 million new-to cruise guests in 2023 and remain well-positioned to take share from land-based alternatives.",
        "We continue to take actions to further stimulate demand and maintain our momentum through 2024 and beyond.",
        "We are focused on ongoing improvements across the commercial space as we further rollout advancements to our yield management tools and lead generation techniques, continue to invest in sales and sales support, and build on already strong relationships with our trade partners.",
        "This is complemented by our strategy to pull forward the sale of onboard items through bundled product offerings and pre-cruise sales.",
        "We are also not losing sight of our expense base, as we have worked to mitigate the impacts of a high inflation environment by leveraging our scale through cost optimization initiatives.",
        "We have made investments that we expect to increase our cost efficiencies in the future, including successfully installing SpaceX's Starlink, next generation internet across our fleet, which is expected to drive more than a 20% reduction in cost per megabit in 2024.",
        "In addition, we expect it will increase our bandwidth pipeline, resulting in both improved guest experience and higher onboard revenues.",
        "We also launched Maritime Asset Strategy Transformation (“MAST”), a centralized system developed to optimize equipment and machinery management across our brands and our fleet.During 2023, we continued to work aggressively to reduce our environmental footprint and fuel consumption.",
        "Our deep commitment resulted in industry-leading fuel efficiency and a more than 10% reduction in absolute GHG emissions compared to our peak year of 2011, despite capacity growth of 30% over the same period.",
        "We also exceeded our shore power capability goal and our fleet now has twice as many ships ready to plug into shore power as there are ports currently able to provide it.",
        "As a result of our fleet optimization efforts, our fleet is now one year younger than prior to pausing our guest cruise operations four years ago.",
        "During 2023 alone we benefited from the introduction of three fantastic new ships including Carnival Celebration and Arvia, leveraging the scale of our popular and exceptionally efficient series of excel-class ships, and Seabourn Pursuit, our second luxury expedition ship.",
        "In addition, Carnival Cruise Line welcomed Carnival Venezia, which was transferred from Costa, becoming the first ship as part of Carnival’s Fun Italian Style™ platform.",
        "We will continue to optimize our brand portfolio by transferring Costa Firenze to Carnival Cruise Line in 2024. We also made meaningful progress in other strategic asset projects.",
        "We began construction on Celebration Key in Grand Bahama, which will be the largest and closest exclusive destination in our portfolio.",
        "While not expected to open until summer 2025, we have begun generating consumer awareness and excitement around this fantastic upcoming destination.",
        "We also started the process for a significant upsize in guest traffic at Half Moon Cay, our exclusive and beautiful pristine island destination in The Bahamas, with the creation of a pier-side berth that can accommodate our largest vessels.",
        "In addition, we commenced work with our Grand Bahama Shipyard partners on the construction of two floating docks, one of which will have the largest lifting capacity in the world.",
        "Together, these strategic investments are expected to significantly benefit us by helping to reduce travel time, further reducing our fuel consumption and preserving ship revenue days.Our significantly improved 2023 cash from operations enabled us to notably reduce the substantial debt balance incurred during the pause of guest cruise operations.",
        "In 2023, we made sizeable debt prepayments and ended the year with over $5 billion of liquidity.",
        "Looking forward, we expect to continue to strategically refinance and prepay debt, leveraging our improving operating cash flow and the return of substantially all of the remaining credit card reserves during the first quarter of 2024.",
        "48In addition, with nearly two-thirds of 2024 on the books already, we are well positioned to achieve another year of record revenues.",
        "This, combined with excess liquidity, is expected to enable us to continue actively managing down debt and reducing interest expense, leaving us on our path back to achieving investment grade credit ratings and higher return on invested capital.This has been a truly remarkable year, and we have come a long way in an incredibly short amount of time.",
        "We delivered unforgettable happiness to over 12 million guests this year and look forward to continuing to provide our guests with extraordinary cruise vacations in 2024, while honoring the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visit and life we touch.",
        "New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to our consolidated financial statements for further information on Accounting Pronouncements.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur critical accounting estimates are those we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.",
        "A discussion of our critical accounting estimates, the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows: Liquidity and Other UncertaintiesWe make several critical accounting estimates with respect to our liquidity.As part of our liquidity management, we rely on estimates of our future liquidity, which includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.",
        "The principal assumptions used to estimate our future liquidity consist of: •Expected increases in revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023•Expected prepayment of debt•Continued stabilization of inflationary pressures on costs compared to 2023•Fuel prices at or around November 2023 year-end pricesIn addition, we make certain assumptions about new ship deliveries, improvements on existing ships as well as other capital expenditures, removals of existing ships, and consider the future export credit financings that are associated with the new ship deliveries.We have a substantial debt balance incurred during the pause in guest cruise operations and require a significant amount of liquidity or cash provided by operating activities to service our debt.",
        "We will continue to pursue various opportunities to refinance future debt maturities to extend maturity dates and reduce interest expense by repaying some of our existing indebtedness.Ship Accounting We make several critical accounting estimates with respect to our ship accounting including ship improvement costs, estimated useful lives and residual values.We account for ship improvement costs, including replacements of certain significant components and parts, by capitalizing those costs that we believe add value to our ships and have a useful life greater than one year and depreciating those improvements over their estimated remaining useful life.",
        "The costs of repairs and maintenance, including those incurred when a ship is taken out-of-service for scheduled maintenance, and minor improvement costs and expenses, are charged to expense as incurred.",
        "If we change our assumptions in making our determinations as to whether improvements to a ship add value, the amounts we expense each year as repair and maintenance expense could increase, which would be partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense, resulting from a reduction in capitalized costs.In addition, the specifically identified or estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of previously capitalized ship components are written-off upon retirement, which may result in a loss on disposal that is also included in other operating expenses.",
        "We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ships.",
        "In addition, since we do not separately componentize our ships, we do not identify and track depreciation of original ship components.",
        "Therefore, we typically have to estimate the net book value of components that are retired, based primarily upon their replacement cost, their age and their original estimated useful lives.",
        "Given the large size and complexity of our ships, ship accounting estimates require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain.",
        "49In order to compute our ships’ depreciation expense, we apply judgment to determine their useful lives as well as their residual values.",
        "We have estimated our ships’ useful lives at 30 years and residual values at 15% of our original ship cost.",
        "Our ships’ useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the estimated weighted-average useful lives of the ships’ major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins.",
        "We also take into consideration the impact of technological changes, historical useful lives of similarly-built ships, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and regulatory changes, including those related to the environment and climate change.",
        "We determine the residual value of our ships based on our long-term estimates of their resale value at the end of their useful lives to us but before the end of their physical and economic lives to others, historical resale values of our and other cruise ships as well as our expectations of the long-term viability of the secondary cruise ship market.",
        "We review estimated useful lives and residual values for reasonableness whenever events or circumstances significantly change.",
        "Since the pause of our guest cruise operations, we have disposed of ships for amounts significantly below their book values.",
        "Management has estimated that this trend will normalize in the coming years.The IMO recently adopted its 2023 Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships that would require international shipping to reduce total GHG emissions on a well-to-wake basis to net zero by or around 2050.",
        "In addition, the framework introduces checkpoints in 2030 and 2040 that seek reductions in the total GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 20% and 70%, respectively, compared to 2008.",
        "The EU has also proposed several regulations that will likely impact the cost of fossil fuels and has recently adopted the inclusion of maritime shipping in the EU’s Emission Trading System.",
        "We have established Climate Action Goals, which include a GHG intensity reduction goal of 20% by 2030 from the 2019 baseline and pursuing net zero emissions by 2050.",
        "Given a 30-year estimated useful life for our ships, our most recently delivered vessels’ lives will extend beyond this 2050 date.",
        "Fossil fuels are currently the only viable option for our industry and it is not clear when alternative fuels or other technologies will be commercially viable.",
        "To provide a path to net zero emissions, alternative low GHG emission fuels will be necessary for the maritime industry; however, there are significant supply challenges that must be resolved before viability is reached.",
        "We are closely monitoring technology developments and partnering with key organizations on research and development to support our sustainability goals and aspirations.",
        "Our fleet’s engines are capable of being modified for use with certain alternative fuels and we have completed tests on the use of marine biofuel blends on certain ships in our fleet.",
        "In addition, and in support of our Climate Action Goals, we invest in technologies, including the use of LNG powered cruise ships, the installation of Advanced Air Quality Systems on board our ships to aid in the reduction of sulfur emissions, the use of shore power, enabling ships to use shoreside electric power where available while in port and various other efficiency related upgrades intended to reduce our emissions.",
        "It is uncertain how recently adopted, proposed and possible future regulatory changes related to the environment and climate change and our pursuit of net zero emissions by 2050, may impact our ships’ useful lives and residual values and the impact is dependent on future regulatory actions and technological advances.",
        "As of November 30, 2023, management concluded that there were no changes in our ship useful lives and residual value estimates.If materially different conditions existed, or if we materially changed our assumptions of ship useful lives and residual values, then our depreciation expense, loss on retirement of ship components and net book value of our ships would be materially different.",
        "Our 2023 ship depreciation expense would have increased by approximately:•$49 million assuming we had reduced our estimated 30-year ship useful life estimate by one year at the time we took delivery or acquired each of our ships•$245 million assuming we had estimated our ships to have no residual valueWe believe that the estimates we made for ship accounting purposes are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied in all material respects and result in depreciation expense that is based on a rational and systematic method to equitably allocate the costs of our ships to the periods during which we use them.",
        "Valuation of ShipsImpairment reviews of our ships require us to make significant estimates.",
        "We evaluate ship asset impairments at the individual ship level which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.",
        "We review our ships for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a ship may not be recoverable.",
        "If estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of a ship, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.",
        "Where estimated future cash flows are used to estimate the recoverable value of a ship, the cash flows include estimated regulatory costs, including those related to proposed regulations, which are likely to impact costs and capital expenditures, including those expected to meet our 2030 Climate Action Goals.The estimation of a ship’s fair value includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.",
        "The principal assumption used in determining the fair value of these ships was the estimated sales proceeds.We determined the fair value of these ships based on their respective estimated selling values, for those ships expected to be disposed of, or estimated discounted future cash flows and comparable market transactions.",
        "Refer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our property and equipment policy and ship impairment reviews. 50We believe that we have made reasonable estimates.",
        "ContingenciesWe periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us, as well as for other known unasserted claims, including environmental, legal, regulatory and guest and crew matters.",
        "While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these matters, we use our best judgment to determine the appropriate amounts to record in our consolidated financial statements.",
        "We accrue a liability and establish a reserve when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.",
        "In assessing probable losses, we make estimates of the amount of probable insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets where appropriate.",
        "Such accruals and reserves are typically based on developments to date, management’s estimates of the outcomes of these matters, our experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar matters, historical claims experience, actuarially determined estimates of liabilities and any related insurance coverage.",
        "Given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of these matters and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we may have made.",
        "In addition, as new information becomes available, we may need to reassess the amount of asset or liability that needs to be accrued related to our contingencies.",
        "All such changes in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.Refer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of contingencies.Known Trends and Uncertainties•We believe the volatility in the cost of fuel and increases in other related costs are reasonably likely to continue to impact our profitability in both the short and long-term.",
        "•We believe inflation and interest rates are reasonably likely to continue to impact our profitability.",
        "•We believe a global minimum tax could affect us in 2026, with the potential for a one-year deferral.",
        "Prior to any mitigating actions, we believe the annual impact could be approximately $200 million.",
        "We continue to evaluate the impact of these rules and are currently evaluating a variety of mitigating actions to minimize the impact.",
        "The application of the rules continues to evolve, and its outcome may alter our tax obligations in certain countries in which we operate.•We believe the increasing global focus on climate change, including the reduction of GHG emissions and new and evolving regulatory requirements, is reasonably likely to have a material negative impact on our future financial results.",
        "We became subject to the EU Emission Trading Scheme (“ETS”) on January 1, 2024, which includes a three-year phase-in period.",
        "We estimate the impact in 2024 to be approximately $51 million based on a European Union Allowance cost of $75 per metric ton of emissions. Refer to XIX.",
        "Governmental Regulations.•We believe that the instability in the Red Sea region currently impacting shipping could have an impact on our results of operations.Results of OperationsWe have historically earned substantially all of our cruise revenues from the following: •Sales of passenger cruise tickets and, in some cases, the sale of air and other transportation to and from airports near our ships’ home ports and cancellation fees.",
        "We also collect fees, taxes and other charges from our guests.",
        "The cruise ticket price typically includes the following: •Accommodations •Most meals, including snacks at numerous venues •Access to amenities such as swimming pools, water slides, water parks, whirlpools, a health club and sun decks •Child care and supervised youth programs •Entertainment, such as theatrical and comedy shows, live music and nightclubs •Visits to multiple destinations51•Sales of onboard goods and services not included in the cruise ticket price.",
        "This generally includes the following: • Beverage sales • Internet and communication services • Casino gaming • Full service spas • Shore excursions • Specialty restaurants • Retail sales • Art sales • Photo sales • Laundry and dry cleaning servicesThese goods and services are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires, from which we receive either a percentage of their revenues or a fee.",
        "Concession revenues do not have direct expenses because the costs and services incurred for concession revenues are borne by our concessionaires.",
        "In 2023, we earned 34% of our cruise revenues from onboard and other revenue goods and services.We earn our tour and other revenues from our hotel and transportation operations and other revenues.",
        "We incur cruise operating expenses for the following:•The costs of passenger cruise bookings, which include travel agent commissions, cost of air and other transportation, port fees, taxes, and charges that directly vary with guest head counts and credit and debit card fees•Onboard and other cruise costs, which include the costs of beverage sales, costs of shore excursions, costs of retail sales, internet and communication costs, credit and debit card fees, other onboard costs, costs of cruise vacation protection programs and pre- and post-cruise land packages•Payroll and related costs, which include the costs of officers and crew in bridge, engineering and hotel operations.",
        "Substantially all costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in selling and administrative expenses•Fuel costs, which include fuel delivery costs•Food costs, which include both our guest and crew food costs•Other ship operating expenses, which include port costs that do not vary with guest head counts; repairs and maintenance, including minor improvements and dry-dock expenses; hotel costs; entertainment; gains and losses on ship sales; ship impairments; freight and logistics; insurance premiums and all other ship operating expensesWe incur tour and other costs and expenses for our hotel and transportation operations and other expenses.52Statistical Information Years Ended November 30,202320222021Passenger Cruise Days (“PCDs”) (in millions) (a)91.4 54.6 8.2 Available Lower Berth Days (“ALBDs”) (in millions) (b)91.3 72.5 14.6 Occupancy percentage (c)100 %75 %56 %Passengers carried (in millions)12.5 7.7 1.2 Fuel consumption in metric tons (in millions)2.9 2.6 1.3 Fuel consumption in metric tons per thousand ALBDs32.1 36.1 (d)Fuel cost per metric ton consumed$701 $830 $515 Currencies (USD to 1) AUD$0.66 $0.70 $0.75 CAD$0.74 $0.77 $0.80 EUR$1.08 $1.06 $1.19 GBP$1.24 $1.25 $1.38 Notes to Statistical Information(a)PCD represents the number of cruise passengers on a voyage multiplied by the number of revenue-producing ship operating days for that voyage.(b)ALBD is a standard measure of passenger capacity for the period that we use to approximate rate and capacity variances, based on consistently applied formulas that we use to perform analyses to determine the main non-capacity driven factors that cause our cruise revenues and expenses to vary.",
