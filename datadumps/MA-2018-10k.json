        "Item 1.If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and/or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats.",
        "Our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth.",
        "We also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payments systems, e-commerce payments systems and payments systems for mobile devices, as well as physical store locations.",
        "A number of these new entrants rely principally on the Internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.",
        "Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.Disintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business.As the payments industry continues to develop and change, we face disintermediation and related risks, including:•Parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position as an intermediary in the payment process.",
        "For example, merchants could switch (and in some cases are switching) transactions directly with issuers. Additionally, processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers.",
        "Large scale consolidation within processors could result in these processors developing bilateral agreements or in some cases switching the entire transaction on their own network, thereby disintermediating us.•Regulation in the EEA may disintermediate us by enabling third-party processors opportunities to route payment transactions away from our networks and towards other forms of payment.•Although we partner with technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) that leverage our technology, platforms and networks to deliver their products, they could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate us from digital payments and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy.",
        "This risk is heightened when we have relationships with these entities where we share Mastercard data.",
        "While we share this data in a controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and data privacy standards, without proper oversight we could inadvertently share too much data which could give the partner a competitive advantage.24Table of Contents•Competitors, customers, technology companies, governments and other industry participants may develop products that compete with or replace value-added products and services we currently provide to support our switched transaction and payment offerings.",
        "These products could replace our own switching and payments offerings or could force us to change our pricing or practices for these offerings.",
        "In addition, governments that develop national payment platforms may promote their platforms in such a way that could put us at a competitive disadvantage in those markets.•Participants in the payments industry may merge, create joint ventures or form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business services or create new payment services that compete with our services.Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.Continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.In order to increase transaction volumes, enter new markets and expand our Mastercard-branded cards and enabled products and services, we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives, pricing discounts and other support that promote our products.",
        "In order to stay competitive, we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts. Over the past several years, we have experienced continued pricing pressure.",
        "The demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth.",
        "We may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.",
        "In addition, increased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives.In the future, we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling to offer, and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry.",
        "Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers.",
        "In addition, to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements, we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit, and we may not be successful in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment.",
        "Our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability.",
        "These factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.Rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future growth.The payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, which can impact our business in several ways:•Technological changes, including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency and block chain technology, machine learning and AI, could result in new technologies that may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our programs and services.",
        "Moreover, these changes could result in new and innovative payment methods and programs that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of our products.•We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies.",
        "The inability of these companies to keep pace with technological developments, or the acquisition of these companies by competitors, could negatively impact our offerings.•Our ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards (such as those related to EMV, tokenization or other safety and security technologies), and by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes.•Our ability to develop evolving systems and products may be inhibited by any difficulty we may experience in attracting and retaining technology experts.•Our ability to adopt these technologies can also be inhibited by intellectual property rights of third parties.",
        "We have received, and we may in the future receive, notices or inquiries from patent holders (for example, other operating companies or non-practicing entities) suggesting that we may be infringing certain patents or that we need to license the use of their patents to avoid infringement.",
        "Such notices may, among other things, threaten litigation against us or our customers or demand significant license fees.25Table of Contents•Our ability to develop new technologies and reflect technological changes in our payments offerings will require resources, which may result in additional expenses.•We work with technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) that use our technology to enhance payment safety and security and to deliver their payment-related products and services quickly and efficiently to consumers.",
        "Our inability to keep pace technologically could negatively impact the willingness of these customers to work with us, and could encourage them to use their own technology and compete against us.We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business, and our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate, develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards.",
        "Failure to keep pace with these technological developments or otherwise bring to market products that reflect these technologies could lead to a decline in the use of our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.Operating a new real-time account-based payments network in connection with our Vocalink acquisition presents risks that could materially affect our business.Our acquisition of Vocalink in 2017 added real-time account-based payment technology to the suite of capabilities we offer.",
        "While expansion into this space presents business opportunities, there are also regulatory and operational risks associated with administering a new type of payments network and with integrating this acquisition into our business.Operating a new type of payments system presents new regulatory and operational risks.",
        "English regulators have designated this platform to be “critical national infrastructure” and regulators in other countries may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of real-time account-based payments systems in similar ways.",
        "In addition, any prolonged service outage on this network could result in quickly escalating impacts, including potential intervention by the Bank of England and significant reputational risk to Vocalink and us.",

        "Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesOrganizationMastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard International” and together with Mastercard Incorporated, “Mastercard” or the “Company”), is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.",
        "The Company facilitates the switching (authorization, clearing and settlement) of payment transactions, and delivers related products and services.",
        "The Company makes payments easier and more efficient by creating a wide range of payment solutions and services through a family of well-known brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®.",
        "The recent acquisition of VocaLink Holdings Limited (“Vocalink”) has expanded the Company’s capability to process automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions, among other things.",
        "As a multi-rail network, Mastercard now offers customers one partner to turn to for their payment needs for both domestic and cross-border transactions.",
        "The Company also provides value-added offerings such as safety and security products, information services and consulting, loyalty and reward programs and issuer and acquirer processing.",
        "The Company’s networks are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.",
        "A typical transaction on the Company’s core network involves four participants in addition to the Company: account holder (an individual who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), merchant, issuer (the account holders’ financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).",
        "The Company does not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of the Company’s branded products.",
        "In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, the Company’s financial institution customers.Mastercard generates revenues from assessing its customers based on the gross dollar volume (“GDV”) of activity on the products that carry its brands, from the fees charged to customers for providing transaction processing and from other payment-related products and services.Significant Accounting PoliciesConsolidation and basis of presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mastercard and its majority-owned and controlled entities, including any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.",
        "Investments in VIEs for which the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and are accounted for as equity method or cost method investments and recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.",
        "At December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no significant VIEs which required consolidation and the investments were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation.",
        "The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).Prior to December 31, 2017, the Company included the financial results from its Venezuela subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements using the consolidation method of accounting.",
        "Due to increasing foreign exchange regulations in Venezuela restricting access to U.S. dollars, an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S.",
        "dollar has impacted the ability to manage risk, process cross-border transactions and satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities related to operations in Venezuela.",
        "As a result of these factors, Mastercard concluded that effective December 31, 2017, it did not meet the accounting criteria for consolidation of these Venezuelan subsidiaries, and therefore would transition to the cost method of accounting as of December 31, 2017.",
        "This accounting change resulted in a pre-tax charge of $167 million ($108 million after tax, or $0.10 per diluted share) included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.Non-controlling interests represent the equity interest not owned by the Company and are recorded for consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the interests.",
        "Changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and upon loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.",
        "For 2017, 2016 and 2015, losses from non-controlling interests were de minimis and, as a result, amounts are included on the consolidated statement of operations within other income (expense).",
        "The Company accounts for investments in common stock or in-substance common stock under the equity method of accounting when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee, generally when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership 65Table of ContentsMASTERCARD INCORPORATEDNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)in the entity.",
        "In addition, investments in flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies are also accounted for under the equity method when the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee, generally when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of the outstanding ownership interest.",
        "The excess of the cost over the underlying net equity of investments accounted for under the equity method is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on fair values at the date of acquisition.",
        "The amortization of the excess of the cost over the underlying net equity of investments and Mastercard’s share of net earnings or losses of entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting is included in other income (expense) on the consolidated statement of operations.",
        "The Company accounts for investments in common stock or in-substance common stock under the cost method of accounting when it does not exercise significant influence, generally when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity or when the interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company is less than 5% and the Company has no significant influence over the operation of the investee.",
        "Investments in companies that Mastercard does not control, but that are not in the form of common stock or in-substance common stock, are also accounted for under the cost method of accounting.",
        "Investments for which the equity method or cost method of accounting is used are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.Use of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.",
        "Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment.",
        "The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment changes.",
        "Actual results may differ from these estimates.Revenue recognition - Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.",
        "Revenue is generally derived from transactional information accumulated by Mastercard’s systems or reported by customers.",
        "The Company’s revenue is based on the volume of activity on cards that carry the Company’s brands, the number of transactions processed or the nature of other payment-related products and services.Volume-based revenue (domestic assessments and cross-border volume fees) is recorded as revenue in the period it is earned, which is when the related volume is generated on the cards.",
        "Certain volume-based revenue is based upon information reported by customers.",
        "Transaction-based revenue is primarily based on the number and type of transactions and is recognized as revenue in the same period as the related transactions occur.",
        "Other payment-related products and services are recognized as revenue in the same period as the related transactions occur or services are rendered.Mastercard has business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates or other support when the customers meet certain volume hurdles as well as other support incentives such as marketing, which are tied to performance.",
        "Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue either when the revenue is recognized by the Company or at the time the rebate or incentive is earned by the customer.",
        "Rebates and incentives are calculated based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements.",
        "In addition, Mastercard may make payments to a customer directly related to entering into an agreement, which are generally deferred and amortized over the life of the agreement on a straight-line basis.Business combinations - The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting.",
        "The Company measures the tangible and intangible identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, at their fair values at the acquisition date.",
        "Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses.",
        "Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill.Goodwill and other intangible assets - Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of goodwill, which represents the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition date and the assembled workforce, and customer relationships.",
        "Finite-lived intangible assets consist of capitalized software costs, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships and other intangible assets.",
        "Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, on a straight-line basis, which range from one to twenty years.",
        "Capitalized software includes internal and external costs incurred directly related to the design, development and testing phases of each capitalized software project.Impairment of assets - Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter, or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist.",
        "The impairment evaluation for goodwill utilizes a quantitative assessment. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired.",
        "If the 66Table of ContentsMASTERCARD INCORPORATEDNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment charge.",
        "Impairment charges, if any, are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets.",
        "If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, then a quantitative assessment is required.",
        "Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
        "If the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, the fair value of the asset is calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows.",
        "If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment is recorded.Litigation - The Company is a party to certain legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters.",
        "The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of all legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and accrues a loss contingency when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable.",
        "These judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of its defenses and consultation with in-house and external legal counsel.",
        "Legal costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.Settlement and other risk management - Mastercard’s rules guarantee the settlement of many of the Mastercard, Cirrus and Maestro-branded transactions between its issuers and acquirers.",
        "Settlement exposure is the outstanding settlement risk to customers under Mastercard’s rules due to the difference in timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent settlement.",
        "While the term and amount of the guarantee are unlimited, the duration of settlement exposure is short term and typically limited to a few days.",
        "In the event that Mastercard effects a payment on behalf of a failed customer, Mastercard may seek an assignment of the underlying receivables of the failed customer.",
        "Customers may be charged for the amount of any settlement loss incurred during the ordinary course activities of the Company.The Company also enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third parties against damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with the Company.",
        "As the extent of the Company’s obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, the Company’s potential future liability under these agreements is not determinable.",
        "The Company accounts for each of its guarantees by recording the guarantee at its fair value at the inception or modification date through earnings.Income taxes - The Company follows an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes as required under GAAP.",
        "Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.",
        "Deferred income taxes are displayed separately as noncurrent assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Valuation allowances are provided against assets which are not more likely than not to be realized.",
        "The Company recognizes all material tax positions, including uncertain tax positions in which it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits and if challenged by the relevant taxing authorities.",
        "At each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions are reassessed to determine whether subsequent developments require a change in the amount of recognized tax benefit.",
        "The allowance for uncertain tax positions is recorded in other current and noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.The Company records interest expense related to income tax matters as interest expense in its consolidated statement of operations.",
        "The Company includes penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision.",
        "On December 22, 2017, in the U.S., “An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018”, a comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), was enacted into law.",
        "Prior to the enactment of the TCJA, the Company did not historically provide for U.S. federal income tax and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings from non-U.S.",
        "subsidiaries as such earnings were intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the U.S.",
        "The foreign earnings that the Company had repatriated to the United States, for periods prior to the enactment of the TCJA, were limited to the amount of current year foreign earnings and not made out of historic undistributed accumulated earnings.",
        "As of December 31, 2017, the Company has changed its assertion regarding the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings outside the U.S. for certain foreign affiliates.",
        "As a result of the TCJA and a one-time 67Table of ContentsMASTERCARD INCORPORATEDNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, a provisional amount of U.S.",
        "federal and state and local income taxes have been provided on all undistributed foreign earnings. Future distributions from foreign affiliates from earnings which have not already been taxed in the U.S.",
        "will be eligible for a 100% dividends received deduction.",
        "Beginning in 2018, deferred taxes will be established on the estimated foreign exchange gains or losses for foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested, which will be recognized through cumulative translation adjustments as incurred.",
        "The working capital requirements of foreign affiliates will determine the amount of cash to be remitted from respective jurisdictions.Cash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include certain investments with daily liquidity and with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.",
        "Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.Restricted cash - The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents as restricted when the cash is unavailable for withdrawal or usage for general operations.",
        "Restrictions may include legally restricted deposits, contracts entered into with others, or the Company’s statements of intention with regard to particular deposits.",
        "Fair value - The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis by estimating the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.",
        "The Company classifies these recurring fair value measurements into a three-level hierarchy (“Valuation Hierarchy”).The Valuation Hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.",
        "A financial instrument’s categorization within the Valuation Hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.",
        "The three levels of the Valuation Hierarchy are as follows: •Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.•Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in inactive markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability.•Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be directly corroborated by observable market data.Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.",
        "The Company’s assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include property, plant and equipment, nonmarketable equity investments, goodwill and other intangible assets.",
        "These assets are subject to impairment evaluation and if impaired, would be adjusted to fair value.The valuation methods for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations involve assumptions concerning comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions.",
        "The Company uses various valuation techniques to determine fair value, primarily discounted cash flows analysis, relief-from-royalty, and multi-period excess earnings for estimating the fair value of its intangible assets.",
        "The Company’s uses market capitalization for estimating the fair value of its reporting unit.",
        "As the assumptions employed to measure these assets are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified in Level 3 of the Valuation Hierarchy.",
        "Contingent consideration - Certain business combinations involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones.",
        "These liabilities are classified within Level 3 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment.",
        "The fair value of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date and subsequent periods is determined utilizing an income approach based on a Monte Carlo technique and is recorded in other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.",
        "Changes to projected performance milestones of the acquired businesses could result in a higher or lower contingent consideration liability.",
        "Measurement period adjustments, if any, to the preliminary estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of the acquisition date will be recorded to goodwill, however, changes in fair value as a result of updated assumptions will be recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.Investment securities - The Company classifies investments in debt and equity securities as available-for-sale.",
        "Available-for-sale securities that are available to meet the Company’s current operational needs are classified as current assets.",
        "Available-for-sale securities that are not available to meet the Company’s current operational needs are classified as non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.68Table of ContentsMASTERCARD INCORPORATEDNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)The investments in debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.",
