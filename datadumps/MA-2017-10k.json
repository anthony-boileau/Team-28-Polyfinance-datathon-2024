        "Item 1.If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and/or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats.",
        "Our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth.",
        "We also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payments systems, e-commerce payments systems and payments systems for mobile devices, as well as physical store locations.",
        "A number of these new entrants rely principally on the Internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.",
        "Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.",
        "22Table of ContentsDisintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business.",
        "As the payments industry continues to develop and change, we face disintermediation and related risks, including:•Parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position as an intermediary in the payment process.",
        "For example, merchants could process (and in some cases are processing) transactions directly with issuers. Additionally, processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers.",
        "Large scale consolidation within processors could result in these processors developing bilateral agreements or in some cases processing the entire transaction on their own network, thereby disintermediating us.",
        "•Regulation such as PSD2 in Europe may disintermediate us by enabling new third-party processors and other service providers opportunities to route payment transactions away from our network and towards other forms of payment.",
        "•Although we partner with technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) that leverage our technology, platforms and network to deliver their products, they could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate us from digital payments and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy.•Competitors, customers, technology companies, governments and other industry participants may develop products that compete with or replace value-added products and services we currently provide to support our switched transaction and payment offerings.",
        "These products could replace our own processing and payments offerings or could force us to change our pricing or practices for these offerings.",
        "•Participants in the payments industry may merge, create joint ventures or form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business services or create new payment services that compete with our services.",
        "Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.Continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.",
        "In order to increase transaction volumes, enter new markets and expand our Mastercard-branded cards and enabled payment devices, we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives, pricing discounts and other support that promote our products.",
        "In order to stay competitive, we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts. Over the past several years, we have experienced continued pricing pressure.",
        "The demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth.",
        "We may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.",
        "In addition, increased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives.In the future, we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling to offer, and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry.",
        "Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers.",
        "In addition, to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements, we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit, and we may not be successful in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment.",
        "Our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability.",
        "These factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.Rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future growth.",
        "The payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, which can impact our business in several ways:•Technological changes, including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce and cryptocurrency and block chain technology, could result in new technologies that may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our programs and services.",
        "Moreover, these changes could result in new and innovative payment methods and programs that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of Mastercard products.23Table of Contents•We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies.",
        "The inability of these companies to keep pace with technological developments, or the acquisition of these companies by competitors, could negatively impact Mastercard offerings.•Our ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards (such as those related to EMV, tokenization or other safety and security technologies), and by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes.•Our ability to develop evolving systems and products may be inhibited by any difficulty we may experience in attracting and retaining technology experts.•Our ability to adopt these technologies can also be inhibited by intellectual property rights of third parties.",
        "We have received, and we may in the future receive, notices or inquiries from patent holders (for example, other operating companies or non-practicing entities) suggesting that we may be infringing certain patents or that we need to license the use of their patents to avoid infringement.",
        "Such notices may, among other things, threaten litigation against us or our customers or demand significant license fees.•Our ability to develop new technologies and reflect technological changes in our payments offerings will require resources, which may result in additional expenses.•We work with technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) that use our technology to enhance payment safety and security and to deliver their payment-related products and services quickly and efficiently to consumers.",
        "Our inability to keep pace technologically could negatively impact the willingness of these customers to work with us, and could encourage them to use their own technology and compete against us.We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business, and our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate, develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards.",
        "Failure to keep pace with these technological developments or otherwise bring to market products that reflect these technologies could lead to a decline in the use of our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.Information Security and Service DisruptionsInformation security failures or breaches could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.",
        "Information security risks for payments and technology companies such as Mastercard have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties.",
        "These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error or accidental technological failure.",
        "These threats include cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches.Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks.",
        "Our customers and other parties in the payments value chain, as well as our cardholders, rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct their operations.",
        "In addition, to access our products and services, our customers and cardholders increasingly use personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control.",
        "We routinely are subject to cyber-threats and our technologies, systems and networks have been subject to cyber-attacks.",
        "Because of our position in the payments value chain, we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks.",
        "Additionally, geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected jurisdictions and their sympathizers.To date, we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches.",
        "However, future attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information (including account data information) or data security compromises.",
        "Such attacks or breaches could also cause service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers (such as the lack of availability of our value-added systems), as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties.",
        "In addition, they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market, additional costs to Mastercard (such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our 24Table of Contentscustomers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities.",
        "If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded.We maintain an information security program, a business continuity program and insurance coverage (each reviewed by our Board of Directors and its Audit Committee), and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection, in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks.",
        "We also periodically test our systems to discover and address any potential vulnerabilities.",
        "Despite these mitigation efforts, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer material breaches and resulting losses in the future, or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all losses.",
        "Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Mastercard and our role in the global payments and technology industries, our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and cardholders when and how they want to be served, our global presence, our extensive use of third-party vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities.",
        "As a result, information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us.",
        "As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.",
        "Any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.Service disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could materially affect our overall business and results of operations.",
        "Our transaction processing systems and other offerings may experience interruptions as a result of technology malfunctions, fire, weather events, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence, accidents or other catastrophic events.",
        "Our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists, activists, or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities and/or systems.",
        "Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network.",
        "Inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets could also result in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to do business in those markets.",
        "If one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions, terrorism, hacking or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services.",
        "Although we maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies, we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks, because of the intrinsic importance of our processing systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially adversely affect our overall business and our results of operations.Financial Institution Customers and Other Stakeholder RelationshipsLosing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest financial institution customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations.",
        "Most of our financial institution customer relationships are not exclusive and may be terminated by our customers.",
        "Our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future and/or develop their own competitive services.",
        "Accordingly, our business agreements with these customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors, or for other reasons, or might not meet their contractual obligations to us.In addition, a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest financial institution customers.",
        "Loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.",
        "Exclusive/near exclusive relationships certain customers have with our competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business.",
        "Certain customers have exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with our competitors to issue payment products, and these relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues.",
        "In addition, these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our cards, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.",
        "Furthermore, we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearly-exclusive relationships with our competitors.",
        "Such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned.",
        "A significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.25Table of ContentsConsolidation in the banking industry could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.",
        "The banking industry has undergone substantial, accelerated consolidation in the past. Consolidations have included customers with a substantial Mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor.",
        "If significant consolidation among customers were to continue, it could result in the substantial loss of business for us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects.",
        "In addition, one or more of our customers could seek to merge with, or acquire, one of our competitors, and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business.",
        "Consolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers, which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers.",
        "These developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and, in many jurisdictions, their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands.While we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system, including merchants, governments and large digital companies and other technology companies, we are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services.",
        "We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders using our products.",
        "Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features.",
        "In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers.",
        "As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them.",
        "In turn, our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence.",
        "If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk.",
        "See our risk factor in “Risk Factors - Settlement and Third-Party Obligation Risk” in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations for further discussion.With the exception of the United States and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions conducted using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus cards are authorized, cleared and settled by our customers or other processors.",
        "Because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not, as described above, have direct relationships with cardholders, we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries.",
        "We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships with them.",
        "From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.",
        "If our customers’ actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands, cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs, which could reduce our revenues and negatively impact our results of operations.Merchants’ continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.",
        "Merchants are important constituents in our payments system.",
        "We rely on both our relationships with them, as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our cards and payment devices.",
        "We also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase revenues and fight fraud.",
        "In the retail industry, there is a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence.",
        "We believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including Mastercard.",
        "Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard has been defending, including the U.S. merchant litigations.",
        "See our risk factor in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to payments industry regulation, including interchange fees.",
        "The continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment, including in connection with the growth of digital payments, may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.Certain larger merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards and devices.",
        "We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create co-branded payment programs with us.",
        "As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.",
        "Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives.",
        "Additionally, if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer.26Table of ContentsOur work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations.",
        "As we increase our work with national, state and local governments, both indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments.",
        "These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:•Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies.",
        "Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including disruptions in governmental operations, could impact approved funding and result in changes in the scope, or lead to the termination of, the arrangements or contracts we or financial institutions enter into with respect to our payment products and services.",
        "•Our work with governments subjects us to U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.",
        "A violation and subsequent judgment or settlement under these laws could subject us to substantial monetary penalties and damages and have a significant reputational impact.",
        "•Working or contracting with governments, either directly or via our financial institution customers, can subject us to heightened reputational risks, including extensive scrutiny and publicity, as well as a potential association with the policies of a government as a result of a business arrangement with that government.",
        "Any negative publicity or negative association with a government entity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.Settlement and Third-Party ObligationsOur role as guarantor exposes us to risk of loss or illiquidity.",
        "We are a guarantor of certain third-party obligations, including those of:•principal customers, which are customers that participate directly in Mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate customers•affiliate debit licenseesIn this capacity, we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity:•We may incur obligations in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems, liquidity shortfalls, insolvency or other reasons.•If a principal customer or affiliate debit licensee of Mastercard is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other customers, we may bear the loss.•Although we are not obligated to do so, we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations, or to keep prepaid cardholders whole if an issuer defaults on its obligation to safeguard unspent prepaid funds.Our gross settlement exposure for our brands was approximately $37 billion as of December 31, 2016.We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by our largest customer on its peak day (including the availability of our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program) and we are able to seek assignment of underlying receivables from a failed customer and may charge customers for settlement losses incurred during Mastercard’s ordinary course activities.",
        "We also minimize the contingent risk of a settlement failure using various strategies, including monitoring our customers’ financial condition, their economic and political operating environments and their compliance with our participation standards.",
        "However, the term and amount of our guarantee of obligations to principal customers is unlimited.",
        "As a result:•Concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several of our smaller customers either on a given day or over a condensed period of time may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our overall business and liquidity.",
        "•Even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure, we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.27Table of ContentsFinancial institution customers in general are directly and indirectly impacted by economic conditions in global financial markets.",
        "These conditions subject us to risk that we may have to perform under our settlement guarantees.",
        "For more information on our settlement exposure and risk assessment and mitigation practices, see Note 19 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.",
        "Separately, Mastercard also provides guarantees to certain customers and other companies indemnifying them from losses stemming from our failure to perform with respect to our products and services or the failure of third parties to perform.",
        "Should an event occur that would trigger any significant indemnification obligation which we owe to any such customers or other companies, such an obligation could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.Global Economic and Political EnvironmentGlobal financial market activity could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.",
        "Adverse economic trends (including distress in financial markets, turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention) have impacted the environment in which we operate.",
        "The condition of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance.",
        "Such impact may include, but is not limited to, the following:•Our customers may:Ørestrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new Mastercard products to mitigate increasing cardholder defaultsØimplement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stabilityØdefault on their settlement obligations, including as a result of sovereign defaults, causing a liquidity crisis for our other customers•Consumer spending can be negatively impacted by:Ødeclining economies, foreign currency fluctuations and the pace of economic recovery, which can change cross-border travel patterns, on which a significant portion of our revenues is dependentØlow levels of consumer and business confidence typically associated with recessionary environments and those markets experiencing relatively high unemployment •Government intervention (including the effect of laws, regulations and/or government investments on or in our financial institution customers), as well as uncertainty due to changing political regimes in executive, legislative and/or judicial branches of government, may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products.•Tightening of credit availability could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility.Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.A decline in cross-border activity could adversely affect our results of operations.",
        "We process substantially all cross-border transactions using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from cross-border volume fees and fees related to switched transactions.",
        "Revenue from processing cross-border and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with the levels and destinations of cross-border travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency.",
        "Cross-border activity may be adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic, weather and other conditions. These include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases.",
        "Additionally, any regulation of interregional interchange fees could negatively impact our cross-border activity, which could decrease the revenue we receive.",
        "Any such decline in cross-border activity could materially adversely affect our results of operations.28Table of ContentsNegative trends in consumer spending could negatively impact our results of operations.",
        "The global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business and government spending.",
        "General economic conditions (such as unemployment, housing and changes in interest rates) and other political conditions (such as devaluation of currencies and government restrictions on consumer spending) in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving our payment cards and devices.",
        "Also, as we are headquartered in the United States, a negative perception of the United States could impact the perception of our company, which could adversely affect our business.Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations.",
        "During 2016, approximately 62% of our revenue was generated from activities outside the United States.",
        "This revenue (and the related expense) could be transacted in a non-functional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues.",
        "Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income.",
        "Our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies.",
        "In addition, some of the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations (including devaluations of currencies) where the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S.",
        "dollar. If the U.S. dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue, this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected.",
        "Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into U.S.",
        "dollars.The occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Reputational Impact Negative brand perception may materially and adversely affect our overall business.",
        "Our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business.",
        "The ability to attract consumers to our branded products and retain them depends upon the external perception of us and our industry.",
        "Our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands.",
        "From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory”.",
        "Additionally, large digital companies and other technology companies who are our customers use our network to build their own acceptance brands, which could cause consumer confusion and decrease the value of our brand.",
        "Moreover, adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also, by association, impair our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny.",
        "We have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace.",
        "Under some circumstances, our use of social media, or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes, could also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brands by disseminating rapidly and globally actual or perceived damaging information about us or our products.",
        "Such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our overall business.Account data breaches could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.",
        "We, our issuers and acquirers, merchants and other third parties process, transmit or store cardholder account and other information in connection with payment cards and devices.",
        "In addition, our customers may sponsor (or we may certify as PCI-compliant) third-party processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands and merchants may use third parties to provide services related to card use.",
        "A breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are processed, transmitted or stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving cards carrying our brands, damage our reputation and lead to claims against us, as well as subject us to regulatory actions.",
        "We routinely encounter account data compromise events, some of which have been high profile, involving merchants and third-party payment processors that process, store or transmit payment card data, which affect millions of Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other types of cardholders.",
        "These events typically involve external agents hacking the merchants’ or third-party processors’ systems and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of those systems.",
        "Further data security breaches may subject us to reputational damage and/or lawsuits involving payment cards carrying our brands.",
        "Damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers, merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices, as well as the trend toward electronic payments, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes, results of operations and prospects for future growth, or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us.29Table of ContentsIn addition to reputational concerns, while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers, we could still face damage claims, which, if upheld, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Fraudulent activity could damage our reputation and encourage regulatory intervention, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices.",
        "Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud.",
        "Cards that use magnetic-stripe technology, still widely used in the United States, continue to raise heightened vulnerabilities to fraud relative to other technologies due to the static nature of the information on the magnetic stripe.",
        "Fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present, such as online commerce, which constitutes an increasing percentage of transactions.",
        "In addition, as outsourcing and specialization become commonplace in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards.",

        "Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesOrganizationMastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard International” and together with Mastercard Incorporated, “Mastercard” or the “Company”), is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.",
        "The Company facilitates the switching (authorization, clearing and settlement) of payment transactions, and delivers related products and services.",
        "The Company makes payments easier and more efficient by creating a wide range of payment solutions and services through a family of well-known brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®.",
        "The Company also provides value-added offerings such as safety and security products, information services and consulting, issuer and acquirer processing, and loyalty and reward programs.",
        "The Company’s network is designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.",
        "A typical transaction on the Company’s network involves four participants in addition to the Company: cardholder (an individual who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), merchant, issuer (the cardholder’s financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).",
        "The Company’s customers encompass a vast array of entities, including financial institutions and other entities that act as “issuers” and “acquirers”, as well as merchants, governments and other businesses.",
        "The Company does not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of the Company’s branded cards.Significant Accounting PoliciesConsolidation and basis of presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mastercard and its majority-owned and controlled entities, including any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.",
        "Investments in VIEs for which the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and are accounted for as equity method or cost method investments and recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.",
        "At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no significant VIEs which required consolidation and the investments were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.",
        "The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).Non-controlling interests represent the equity interest not owned by the Company and are recorded for consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the interests.",
        "Changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and upon loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.",
        "For 2016, 2015 and 2014, income from non-controlling interests was de minimis and, as a result, amounts are included in the consolidated statement of operations within other income (expense).",
        "The Company accounts for investments in common stock or in-substance common stock under the equity method of accounting when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee, generally when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity.",
        "In addition, investments in flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies are also accounted for under the equity method when the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee, generally when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of the outstanding ownership interest.",
        "The excess of the cost over the underlying net equity of investments accounted for under the equity method is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on fair values at the date of acquisition.",
        "The amortization of the excess of the cost over the underlying net equity of investments and Mastercard’s share of net earnings or losses of entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting is included in other income (expense) on the consolidated statement of operations.",
        "The Company accounts for investments in common stock or in-substance common stock under the cost method of accounting when it does not exercise significant influence, generally when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity or when the interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company is less than 5% and the Company has no significant influence over the operation of the investee.",
        "Investments in companies that Mastercard does not control, but that are not in the form of common stock or in-substance common stock, are also accounted for under the cost method of accounting.",
        "Investments for which the equity method or cost method of accounting is used are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.60Table of ContentsMASTERCARD INCORPORATEDNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)Use of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.",
        "Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment.",
        "The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment changes.",
        "Actual results may differ from these estimates.Revenue recognition - Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.",
        "Revenue is generally derived from transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers.",
        "The Company’s revenue is based on the volume of activity on cards that carry the Company’s brands, the number of transactions processed or the nature of other payment-related products and services.Volume-based revenue (domestic assessments and cross-border volume fees) is recorded as revenue in the period it is earned, which is when the related volume is generated on the cards.",
        "Certain volume-based revenue is based upon information reported to us by our customers.",
        "Transaction-based revenue is primarily based on the number and type of transactions and is recognized as revenue in the same period as the related transactions occur.",
        "Other payment-related products and services are recognized as revenue in the same period as the related transactions occur or services are rendered.Mastercard has business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates or other support when the customers meet certain volume hurdles as well as other support incentives such as marketing, which are tied to performance.",
        "Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue either when the revenue is recognized by the Company or at the time the rebate or incentive is earned by the customer.",
        "Rebates and incentives are calculated based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements.",
        "In addition, Mastercard may make payments to a customer directly related to entering into an agreement, which are generally deferred and amortized over the life of the agreement on a straight-line basis.Business combinations - The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting.",
        "The Company measures the tangible and intangible identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, at their fair values at the acquisition date.",
        "Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses.",
        "Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill.Goodwill and other intangible assets - Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of goodwill and customer relationships.",
        "Finite-lived intangible assets consist of capitalized software costs, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships and other intangible assets.",
        "Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, on a straight-line basis, which range from one to twenty years.",
        "Capitalized software includes internal and external costs incurred directly related to the design, development and testing phases of each capitalized software project.Impairment of assets - Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter, or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist.",
        "Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The impairment evaluation utilizes a quantitative assessment using a two-step impairment test.",
        "The first step is to compare the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value.",
        "If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, then no potential impairment is considered to exist.",
        "If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the second step is performed to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit.",
        "An impairment charge would be recorded if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.",
        "Impairment charges, if any, are recorded in general and administrative expenses.The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets.",
        "If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, then a quantitative assessment is required.",
        "Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
        "If the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, the fair value of the asset is calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows.",
        "If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment is recorded.61Table of ContentsMASTERCARD INCORPORATEDNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)Litigation - The Company is a party to certain legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters.",
        "The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of all legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and accrues a loss contingency when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable.",
        "These judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of its defenses and consultation with in-house and external legal counsel.",
        "Legal costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses.Settlement and other risk management - Mastercard’s rules guarantee the settlement of many of the Mastercard, Cirrus and Maestro-branded transactions between its issuers and acquirers.",
        "Settlement exposure is the outstanding settlement risk to customers under Mastercard’s rules due to the difference in timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent settlement.",
        "While the term and amount of the guarantee are unlimited, the duration of settlement exposure is short term and typically limited to a few days.",
        "In the event that Mastercard effects a payment on behalf of a failed customer, Mastercard may seek an assignment of the underlying receivables of the failed customer.",
        "Customers may be charged for the amount of any settlement loss incurred during the ordinary course activities of the Company.The Company also enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third parties against damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with the Company.",
        "As the extent of the Company’s obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, the Company’s potential future liability under these agreements is not determinable.",
        "The Company accounts for each of its guarantees by recording the guarantee at its fair value at the inception or modification date through earnings.Income taxes - The Company follows an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes as required under GAAP.",
        "Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.",
        "Deferred income taxes are displayed as separate line items on the consolidated balance sheet.",
        "In 2015, the Company early adopted accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), which requires all deferred income taxes to be recorded as non-current.",
        "Valuation allowances are provided against assets which are not more likely than not to be realized.",
        "The Company recognizes all material tax positions, including uncertain tax positions in which it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits and if challenged by the relevant taxing authorities.",
        "At each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions are reassessed to determine whether subsequent developments require a change in the amount of recognized tax benefit.",
        "The allowance for uncertain tax positions is recorded in other current and noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.The Company records interest expense related to income tax matters as interest expense in its statement of operations.",
        "The Company includes penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision. The Company does not provide for U.S.",

        "Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.Restricted cash - The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents as restricted when the cash is unavailable for withdrawal or usage for general operations.",
        "Restrictions may include legally restricted deposits, contracts entered into with others, or the Company’s statements of intention with regard to particular deposits.",
        "Fair value - The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis by estimating the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.",
        "The Company classifies these recurring fair value measurements into a three-level hierarchy (“Valuation Hierarchy”).62Table of ContentsMASTERCARD INCORPORATEDNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)The Valuation Hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.",
        "A financial instrument’s categorization within the Valuation Hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.",
        "The three levels of the Valuation Hierarchy are as follows: •Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.•Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in inactive markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability.•Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be directly corroborated by observable market data.Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.",
        "The Company’s assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include property, plant and equipment, nonmarketable equity investments, goodwill and other intangible assets.",
        "These assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment.The valuation methods for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations involve assumptions concerning comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions.",
        "The Company uses discounted cash flows for estimating the fair value of its intangible assets and the Company’s market capitalization for estimating the fair value of its reporting unit.",
        "As the assumptions employed to measure these assets are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified in Level 3 of the Valuation Hierarchy.",
        "Investment securities - The Company classifies investments in debt and equity securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities that are available to meet the Company’s current operational needs are classified as current assets.",
        "Available-for-sale securities that are not available to meet the Company’s current operational needs are classified as non-current assets.The investments in debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.",
        "Net realized gains and losses on debt and equity securities are recognized in investment income on the consolidated statement of operations.",
        "The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses.The Company evaluates its debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment on an ongoing basis.",
        "When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt or equity security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.",
        "The credit loss component of the impairment would be recognized in other income (expense), net while the non-credit loss would remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).",
        "The Company classifies time deposits with maturities greater than 3 months as held-to-maturity.",
        "Held-to-maturity securities that mature within one year are classified as current assets while held-to-maturity securities with maturities of greater than one year are classified as non-current assets.",
        "Time deposits are carried at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheet and are intended to be held until maturity.Derivative financial instruments - The Company records all derivatives at fair value.",
        "The Company’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts are included in Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair value of these contracts are based on inputs, which are observable based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments.",
        "Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are reported in current-period earnings. The Company’s derivative contracts hedge foreign exchange risk and are not entered into for trading or speculative purposes.",
        "The Company did not have any derivative contracts accounted for under hedge accounting as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.The Company has numerous investments in its foreign subsidiaries.",

        "The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.",
        "The effective portion of the foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency denominated debt are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment component of equity.",
        "The ineffective portion, if any, is recognized in earnings in the current period.",
        "The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the net investment hedge each quarter.63Table of ContentsMASTERCARD INCORPORATEDNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)Settlement due from/due to customers - The Company operates systems for clearing and settling payment transactions among Mastercard customers.",
        "Net settlements are generally cleared daily among customers through settlement cash accounts by wire transfer or other bank clearing means.",
        "However, some transactions may not settle until subsequent business days, resulting in amounts due from and due to Mastercard customers.Restricted security deposits held for Mastercard customers - Mastercard requires collateral from certain customers for settlement of their transactions.",
        "The majority of collateral for settlement is in the form of standby letters of credit and bank guarantees which are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.",
        "Additionally, Mastercard holds cash deposits and certificates of deposit from certain customers of Mastercard as collateral for settlement of their transactions, which are recorded as assets on the consolidated balance sheet.",
        "These assets are fully offset by corresponding liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet. Property, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.",
        "Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.",
        "Depreciation of leasehold improvements and amortization of capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense.The useful lives of the Company’s assets are as follows:Asset Category Estimated Useful LifeBuildings 30 yearsBuilding equipment 10 - 15 yearsFurniture and fixtures and equipment 2 - 5 yearsLeasehold improvements Shorter of life of improvement or lease termCapital leases Shorter of life of the asset or lease termLeases - The Company enters into operating and capital leases for the use of premises and equipment.",

        "The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at December 31, the measurement date.",
        "The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of the pension assets.",
        "Overfunded plans are aggregated and recorded in long-term other assets, while underfunded plans are aggregated and recorded as accrued expenses and long-term other liabilities.Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost/(income) is recognized in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.",

        "Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets.",
        "We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.",
        "The impairment evaluation utilizes a quantitative assessment using a two-step impairment test. The first step is to compare the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value.",
        "The Company uses its market capitalization for estimating the fair value of its reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, then no potential impairment is considered to exist.",
        "If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the second step 49Table of Contentsis performed to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit.",
        "An impairment charge would be recorded if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.",
        "The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate all relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets.",
        "In performing the qualitative assessment, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to, macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, and legal and regulatory factors.",
        "If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than their carrying amounts, the Company must perform a quantitative impairment test.The Company’s estimates in the valuation of these assets are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.",
        "These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur."
