## üéØ Project Overview

10K Intelligence revolutionizes financial analysis by transforming complex US annual reports (SEC Form 10-K) into actionable insights through the power of generative AI. Our solution streamlines the analysis of SEC 10-K filings by:

- Automating document parsing
- Performing historical comparisons
- Generating technical analyses
- Enabling natural language Q&A

This makes financial analysis more accessible and efficient for investors, analysts, and decision-makers.

### üåü Key Features

#### Automated Report Parsing

Extract key information from SEC EDGAR filings into structured JSON format, with section-by-section parsing capabilities. Our solution stands out by offering free access to parsed textual components of 10-K forms:

```json
{
  "ticker": "MA",
  "year": 2018,
  "items": [
    {
      ...
      "item": "Item 3.",
      "description": "Legal Proceedings",
      "content": ["ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Refer to Notes 10 (Accrued Expenses and Accrued Litigation) and 18 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.",
      ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "item": "Item 4.",
      "description": "Mine Safety Disclosures",
      "content":[ "ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable."]
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### Advanced Analytics Suite

## AI Explainability

Our system prioritizes accuracy through meticulous source tracking. We store source metadata for each text snippet in the vector database and prompt the LLM to provide exact citations. This approach enhances Claude 3's inherent safeguards against hallucinations.

Example database entry:

```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "year": 2020,
        "ticker": "MA",
        "item": "Item 1.",
        "description": "Business"
    },
    "content": "Mastercard is a food business, we sell breakfast cereal in Algeria"
}
```
Sample LLM answer: "according to their 2020 annual report Section 1 Business description, Mastercad is a food business that sells breakfast cereal in Algeria."

Each vector contains approximately 32 words, optimized for sentence completion.
