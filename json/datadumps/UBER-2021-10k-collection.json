    "ITEM 1. BUSINESSOverviewWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.",
    "We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”).",
    "We connect consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, as well as with other forms of transportation including public transit.",
    "We also connect Riders and other consumers (“Eater(s)”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Delivery People”) for food, grocery and other delivery services.",
    "Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Delivery People are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks.",
    "We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our technology is available in approximately 71 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Our SegmentsAs of December 31, 2020, we had four operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery, Freight and Advanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) and Other Technology Programs.",
    "Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.",
    "ATG and Other Technology Programs is focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.",
    "On December 7, 2020, we announced the sale of Apparate USA LLC (“ATG Business” or “Apparate”), our subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technologies, to Aurora Innovation, Inc.",
    "(“Aurora”). Our ATG Business is included within our ATG and Other Technology Programs segment.",
    "On January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora.MobilityMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis.",
    "Mobility also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (“U4B”), Financial Partnerships, Transit and Vehicle Solutions offerings.We believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity.",
    "We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region.",
    "For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products.",
    "We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms.",
    "Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate.",
    "We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates.",
    "At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.During 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem Inc.",
    "(“Careem”). Dubai-based Careem was founded in 2012, and provides primarily ridesharing and payments services to millions of users in cities across the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan.",
    "For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.DeliveryOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered and, in certain markets, also includes offerings for grocery and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.",
    "We launched our Delivery app over five years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network.",
    "For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times.",
    "Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform.",
    "In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.During 2020, we received regulatory approvals to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (\"Cornershop”\"), operating an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico.",
    "We also completed the acquisition of Postmates Inc. (“Postmates”) in an all-stock transaction and both companies began the process of integrating U.S. operations.",
    "The acquisition of Postmates brings together our global Mobility and Delivery platform with Postmates’ business in the United States to strengthen the 4delivery of food, groceries, essentials, and other goods.",
    "For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.FreightWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry.",
    "Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment.",
    "The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient.",
    "It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax.",
    "Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments.",
    "It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms.",
    "These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or “dead-head” miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments.",
    "Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end.",
    "Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.We serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery.",
    "We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.ATG and Other Technology ProgramsThe ATG and Other Technology Programs segment is primarily responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.",
    "On December 7, 2020, we announced the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora. Our ATG Business is included within our ATG and Other Technology Programs segment.",
    "On January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora.",
    "Also on January 19, 2021, we made a $400 million cash investment in Aurora and entered into a collaboration agreement with Aurora pursuant to which the parties will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network.",
    "We plan to continue to partner with Aurora to effectively leverage our network during the transition to autonomous vehicle technologies.",
    "For additional information, see Note 9 – Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Platform SynergiesOur PlatformThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.",
    "Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.Massive NetworkOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure.",
    "Our network becomes smarter with every trip.",
    "In approximately 10,000 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2021), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.Leading TechnologyWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies.",
    "Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies.",
    "Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational ExcellenceOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with cities and regulators.Product ExpertiseOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide platform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust.We intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with existing platform users.",
    "Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users.",
    "For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended December 31, 2020, over 56% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform.",
    "Additionally, for the three months ended December 31, 2020, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 11.1 Trips per month on average, compared to 5.1 5Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered.",
    "We believe that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience.",
    "Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers.",
    "We exited 2020 with over 5 million members for our Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Postmates Unlimited membership programs.",
    "In 2020, we rolled out our “Super App” view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers, positioning Uber to become the operating system for your everyday life.",
    "Competitive EnvironmentWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets.",
    "We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries.",
    "As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition.",
    "While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do.",
    "The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:•Mobility.",
    "Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services.",
    "In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.",
    "We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for drivers and riders, including Lyft, Didi, OLA, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.•Delivery.",
    "Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, GrubHub, Deliveroo, Glovo, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.",
    "Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.•Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H.",
    "Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.Government RegulationWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment.",
    "Our business is subject to a variety of U.S.",
    "federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation.",
    "These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business.",
    "Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below.MobilityOur platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate.",
    "A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements.",
    "Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business.",
    "Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, the six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions.",
    "This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model.",
    "Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (“TNC”) regulations.",
    "These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.",
    "These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.6In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform.",
    "For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law.",
    "The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.",
    "The Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit.",
    "We unsuccessfully appealed this injunction to the California Court of Appeal, which affirmed the lower court’s ruling and held that we must comply with the preliminary injunction order.",
    "In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.",
    "Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.",
    "See the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A and “Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition, many jurisdictions have municipal bodies that adopted and will adopt regulations that govern our business.",
    "For example:•In London, Transport for London (“TfL”) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal.",
    "In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,” including with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes.",
    "We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.•Since April 2019, Mexico City’s Secretaría de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operational requirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data sharing requirement and a requirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services.",
    "Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.•In January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers.•In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services.",
    "In December 2018, New York City also established a standard for time and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform.",
    "These minimum rates took effect in February 2019.",
    "Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so the future.",
    "In August 2019, New York City issued a regulation to limit how much time drivers providing ride-hailing services can spend cruising streets in busy areas of Manhattan without passengers.",
    "In December 2019, a New York state judge struck down this regulation, which was to come into effect in February 2020. New York City is appealing this ruling.",
    "Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020.",
    "In addition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.",
    "Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.•In December 2017, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) ruled in the Elite referral case that the peer-to-peer ridesharing service UberPOP was inherently linked to a transport service and, accordingly, must be classified as “a service in the field of transport” within the meaning of applicable European Union (“EU”) legislation rather than an information society service.",
    "This ruling requires us to comply with national laws, rules, and regulations, if any, governing transport services in respect of the specific UberPOP product.",
    "The majority of our ridesharing products in the EU currently operate under licensing regimes where one or more of Mobility Drivers, vehicles, or we are required to register or hold licenses to provide services.",
    "As such, while Member States can decide how to interpret this CJEU ruling in their national laws, rules, and regulations in accordance with applicable EU law, we believe the ruling will have a limited impact on our business and operations.•In 2015, German authorities banned our peer-to-peer ridesharing product, UberPOP, after a court ruled that it violated local applicable laws, including transport laws, by intermediating riders with drivers operating without professional licenses.7•In Italy, while we currently have limited ridesharing operations through our licensed ridesharing product, UberBLACK, in Rome and Milan and a taxi product in Turin, we continue to face limitations due to extensive operational requirements faced by licensed drivers.See the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for more information.",
    "This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model.As we continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.Data Privacy and ProtectionOur technology platform, and the user data we collect and process to run our business, are an integral part of our business model and, as a result, our compliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to improve platform user experience and build trust.",
    "Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties.",
    "Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements for covered businesses.Payments and Financial ServicesMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.",
    "For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).",
    "Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions.",
    "In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform.",
    "We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.AntitrustCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S.",
    "and foreign antitrust and competition laws.",
    "An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.",
    "In addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.Intellectual PropertyWe believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate.",
    "Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions.",
    "Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate.",
    "We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive new offerings and technologies.",
    "We continue to develop new technologies to enhance existing offerings and services, and to expand the range of our offerings through research and development (“R&D”) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.SeasonalityMobilityWe typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our 8platform during peak vacation season in North America and Europe.",
    "We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter.",
    "In 2020, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns.",
    "We expect that seasonality will eventually return to its historic patterns as recovery from the pandemic continues.DeliveryWe typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations.",
    "In 2020, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2020 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders.Human Capital at UberEmployeesWe are a global company and as of December 31, 2020, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 22,800 employees globally and operations in approximately 71 countries and approximately 10,000 cities around the world.",
    "Our human capital strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and are able to achieve to their highest capability.",
    "We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools.",
    "We have historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being.",
    "We see the results as feedback on our company culture and use them to measure our progress in improving our employees’ experiences at work, identifying new goals and actions, and making adjustments as needed.",
    "In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operations through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our employees and our workforce management strategy.",
    "In response to the economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, in May 2020, we announced reductions in workforce of approximately 6,700 full-time employee roles.In addition, we asked that all employees who were able to do so work remotely.",
    "These decisions, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees.",
    "As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and social isolation.",
    "The issues of stress and balance were particularly exacerbated among caregivers of young children. To address some of these concerns, we instituted the Global Caregiver Enhanced Flexibility Policy for COVID.",
    "While we had been encouraging flexibility, this written policy provides clarity around the flexible work options available to parents and caregivers. We also amplified our focus on mental health.",
    "For additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our 2020 People and Culture Report.Diversity and InclusionWe celebrate differences, and we work hard to ensure that people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome and valued.",
    "We encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build.",
    "We believe that when employees feel empowered to succeed in a work environment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows.We encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber’s People Team or the Integrity Helpline.Our Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated workforce diversity performance metrics into the compensation packages of our most senior executives in 2019 and 2020, in furtherance of our company-wide One Uber objective.In 2020, much of our responsibility to cultivate greater equity and inclusion focused on the new normal introduced by COVID-19.",
    "As a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially.",
    "To do that, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.",
    "In July 2020, we publicly committed to becoming an anti-racist company.",
    "Some of our commitments to anti-racism include:9•Ridding our platform of racism•Fighting racism with technology•Sustaining equity and belonging for all•Driving equity in the communityFor more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2020 People and Culture Report and our 2020 ESG Report, which are available on our investor relations website.",
    "The information in these reports is not a part of this Form 10-K.",
    "Other ResourcesIn addition to employees discussed above, our business also depends on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations.In relation to those individuals who earn income on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, providing accessible, flexible work in approximately 71 countries.",
    "Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created through its apps.",
    "A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment.",
    "We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work.",
    "Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.",
    "In a 2020 global survey of Mobility Drivers, approximately 78% reported being satisfied with their experience driving with Uber.Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers.",
    "However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities.",
    "Although the situation varies from country to country, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive.",
    "The current binary system of employment classification means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few.",
    "This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work.",
    "Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.•Protections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers, and recently started to implement additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22, as described in more detail below.",
    "•Earnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).",
    "In addition to tips, Drivers using Uber’s platform have earned over $133 billion from the end of 2015 through the end of 2020.•Progression: We have partnered with Arizona State University to offer eligible Drivers and their family members access to over 100 undergraduate degree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship.",
    "In 2020, Drivers enrolled in over 3,200 courses in continuing professional education (entrepreneurship and English language learning) and over 2,300 undergraduate courses with Arizona State University online through our Uber Pro program.•Advocacy: We have also advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.",
    "We believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net.",
    "This includes requiring Uber—and other app based companies—to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app.",

    "Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws.",

    "We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance.",
    "Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors.",
    "Our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies.",
    "These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.Adjusted EBITDAWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) 69stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition and financing related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses.",
    "Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors.",
    "In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges.",
    "To help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, we are excluding the impacts of COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations from Adjusted EBITDA.",
    "Our board and management find the exclusion of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives from Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it allows us and our investors to assess the impact of these response initiatives on our results of operations.COVID-19 Response InitiativesTo support those whose earning opportunities have been depressed as a result of COVID-19, as well as communities hit hard by the pandemic, we have announced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.",
    "The payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19 and Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment are recorded as a reduction to revenue.",
    "The cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA ReconciliationAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.",
    "These limitations include the following:•Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;•Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;•Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;•Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations;•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net; gain (loss) on business divestitures, net; and unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net;, and impairment of debt and equity securities; and•Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.70 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:Year Ended December 31,(In millions)201820192020Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation:Net income (loss) attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.$997 $(8,506)$(6,768)Add (deduct):Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax(10)(6)(20)Provision for (benefit from) income taxes283 45 (192)Loss from equity method investments42 34 34 Interest expense648 559 458 Other (income) expense, net(4,993)(722)1,625 Depreciation and amortization426 472 575 Stock-based compensation expense172 4,596 827 Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements340 353 (35)Driver appreciation award— 299 — Payroll tax on IPO stock-based compensation— 86 — Goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets237 8 317 Acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses15 — 86 Accelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets— — 102 COVID-19 response initiatives— — 106 Gain on lease arrangement, net(4)— (5)Restructuring and related charges, net— 57 362 Adjusted EBITDA$(1,847)$(2,725)$(2,528)The comparability of the results for the periods presented above was impacted by our 2018 Divested Operations.",

    "An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements.",
    "We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.",
    "Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.",
    "For additional information, see the disclosure included in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products and Delivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users.",
    "Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or Delivery meal delivery.",
    "Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we have no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Further, judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net).",
    "We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions.",
    "The assessment of 76whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives.",
    "Because we have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips, and because we cannot control whether Drivers will generate future earnings that we can offset to collect our service fee, we have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.",
    "As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver IncentivesIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received.",
    "Driver incentives that are not for a distinct service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the Drivers at the time or as they are earned by the Drivers, depending on the type of Driver incentive.During the fourth quarter of 2020, we changed our accounting policy related to the presentation of cumulative payments to Drivers in excess of cumulative revenue from Drivers.",
    "Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.",
    "For additional information, see Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Referral incentives offered by us and earned by Drivers for performing marketing services of referring other Drivers to drive on our platform are recorded as sales and marketing expense, as we receive a distinct service.",
    "The amount recorded is the lesser of the amount of the Driver incentive paid or the established fair market value of the distinct service received.",
    "Fair market value of the distinct service is estimated using amounts paid to vendors for similar services.End-User Discounts and PromotionsWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform.",
    "These are offered in various forms and include:•Targeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to specific end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage, or generally increase end-users’ use of our platform.",
    "An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or meal deliveries during a limited time period, and are akin to coupons.",
    "We record the cost of these discounts and promotions as sales and marketing expense at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.•End-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platform and the new end-user takes his or her first ride on the platform.",
    "These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring end-user when earned. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to our platform.",
    "We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expense as sales and marketing expense at the time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.•Market-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants to end-users for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market.",
    "Accordingly, we record the cost of these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the trip is completed.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.",
    "The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.",
    "Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.",
    "Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired driver, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and discount rates.Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.",
    "Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.",
    "During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.",
    "Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.77Embedded DerivativesDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting.",
    "These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value.",
    "These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.",
    "We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public Offering (“QIPO”) conversion option (“QIPO Conversion Option”).",
    "The fair value of these convertible notes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPO dates to the valuation date.",
    "The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield, which was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes.",
    "The discount rate is updated during each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.",
    "Upon closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock.",
    "For additional information, refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Investments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt SecuritiesWe hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence.",
    "Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.",
    "Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
    "We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for investments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets.",
    "This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.",
    "In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees’ securities.",
    "In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment.",
    "The impairment analysis for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors.",
    "If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations.",
    "Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost.",
    "In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost.",
    "In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.",
    "The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.",
    "To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.",
    "A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).",
    "Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
    "Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not own a controlling financial interest, using the equity method.",
    "Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost.",
    "Subsequently, we recognize through our consolidated statement of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the entities’ net income or loss and reflect the amortization 78of basis differences.",
    "In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter in arrears.",
    "Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable.",
    "Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential impairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee’s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the investment, among other factors.",
    "If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment.",
    "The fair value determination, particularly for investments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions.",
    "Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment charges.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, non-income tax, or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.",
    "Certain of these matters include claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.",
    "We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.",
    "If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed.",
    "We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.",
    "Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss.",
    "These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and future events.The outcomes of litigation and other disputes are inherently uncertain.",
    "Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions.",
    "We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method.",
    "The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets.",
    "Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and / or discount rates.",
    "The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.",
    "Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain.",
    "Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination.",
    "Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the ongoing impact of the Tax Act, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates.",
    "While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different.",
    "We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit.",
    "To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties.",
    "In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us.",
    "We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.Insurance ReservesWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation.",
    "The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the 79balance sheet date.",
    "The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.",
    "In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.",
    "These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.",
    "Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process.",
    "Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided.",
    "Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments.",
    "As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from the estimated amounts.While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based CompensationWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of our board of directors, and non-employee advisors.",
    "The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees.",
    "The majority of our outstanding RSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity-event based vesting condition.",
    "The service-based vesting condition for the majority of these awards is satisfied over four years.",
    "The liquidity event-based vesting condition is satisfied upon the occurrence of a qualifying event, which is generally defined as a change in control transaction or the effective date of an initial public offering (“IPO”).",
    "Prior to our IPO in May 2019, no qualifying event had occurred, and we did not recognized any stock-based compensation expense for the RSUs and other awards with both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity event-based vesting condition.We account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period.",
    "We account for forfeitures when they occur.We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date.",
    "The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock (see the section titled “-Common Stock Valuations” below), are estimated as follows:•Expected term.",
    "We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.•Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.",
    "Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.•Expected volatility.",
    "We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.•Expected dividend yield.",
    "Expected dividend yield is zero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.We continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculation on a prospective basis.",
    "As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected term, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.",

    "These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:Interest Rate RiskOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2016 Term Loan Facility and our 2018 Term Loan Facility.",
    "The 2016 Term Loan Facility and 2018 Term Loan Facility are floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements.",
    "A rising interest rate environment will 80increase the amount of interest paid on these loans.",
    "A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the results of our operations.The fair value of our fixed rate notes and 2025 Convertible Notes outstanding will generally fluctuate with movements in interest rates and the market price of our stock.",
    "A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $271 million as of December 31, 2020.Investment Risk Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk.",

    "A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest income by $22 million and $97 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively.",
    "A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our marketable debt securities portfolio.We have significant risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned affiliates, as all of our investments are currently in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information.",

    "federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.",
    "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
    "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.",

    "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 83prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",

    "Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.",
    "This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.",
    "The Company’s Mobility and Delivery revenue was $9,993 million and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue and related discounts and promotions is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis, analyzing the role of the Company in the transactions and the related transaction attributes, including the type of discounts and promotions applied, utilized or earned by the end-user in the transaction and assessing their presentation, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing our audit procedures to evaluate whether transaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
    "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s revenue recognition process, including controls over the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue and discounts and promotions.",
    "These procedures also included, among others, testing, on sample basis, trip transaction attributes and assessing management’s classification by evaluating the Company’s role in the transaction, examining documentation related to arrangement terms, driver statements and rider receipts, discounts and promotions and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on revenue presentation and income statement classification.Valuation of Insurance ReservesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.",
    "The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.",
    "In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.",
    "These reserves are continually reviewed by management and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.",
    "As disclosed by management, the Company’s insurance reserves as of December 31, 2020 were $3,466 million.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing their estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the various actuarial methods and the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs.",

    "Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.As our business has evolved, we believe our new presentation policy is preferable as it better reflects the financial performance of transactions with customers across all of our businesses and provides more clarity about changes in both revenue and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, resulting in improved financial reporting and alignment with financial information used internally by management.",

    "Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.",
    "On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: the incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) applied in lease accounting; fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; 94insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities.",
    "These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.",
    "We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in particular, our impairment assessment related to the determination of the fair values of certain investments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets.",
    "The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations and financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration.",
    "Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities.",
    "Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.",
    "Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality.",
    "We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented.",
    "Our other receivables primarily consist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims.",
    "We rely on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment service providers”) to collect amounts due from end-users.",
    "Payment service providers are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality.",
    "No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020.Certain Significant Risks and UncertaintiesWe have incurred significant net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of 23.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.",
    "Our operations have historically been funded through equity and debt financings.",
    "While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, additional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives.",
    "We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt instruments.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic.",
    "COVID-19 has rapidly impacted market and economic conditions globally.",
    "In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented, including business activities and travel restrictions, and “shelter-at-home” orders, that have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings.",
    "In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows.",
    "The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak both globally and within the United States, including whether there will be further resurgences of COVID-19 in various regions, the distribution of vaccines in various regions, the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-user’ behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 consisted of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, commercial paper, U.S.",

    "The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities.",
    "Refer to Note 10 - Supplemental Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Merchants.Although we pre-authorize forms of payment to mitigate our exposure, we bear the cost of any accounts receivable losses.",
    "We record an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions.",
    "We consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for fare amounts to be direct and incremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are included as cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.",
    "We estimate the allowance based on historical experience, estimated future payments and geographical trends, which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.",
    "Chargebacks and credit card losses were $208 million, $195 million and $178 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.",
    "Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight‑line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:Property and EquipmentEstimated Useful LifeLandIndefiniteBuildings30-45 yearsSite improvements5-15 yearsLeased vehicles3-10 yearsComputer equipment3-5 yearsFurniture and fixtures3-5 yearsDockless e-bikes3 yearsInternal-use software2 yearsLeased computer equipmentShorter of estimated useful life or lease termLeasehold improvementsShorter of estimated useful life or lease termWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized.",
    "Maintenance and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset’s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred.We capitalize certain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding debt, in developing internal-use software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will function as intended.",
    "Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and begins once the asset is ready for its intended use.",
    "Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred.",
    "In addition, we capitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.96Leased vehicle assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.",
    "The vast majority of our leased vehicle assets were reclassified to assets held for sale as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, an agreement was executed with Waydrive Holdings Pte. Ltd.",
    "(“Waydrive”) to purchase the Lion City Rentals Pte. Ltd. (“LCR”), a wholly-owned vehicle solutions subsidiary of ours based in Singapore. Refer to Note 19 - Divestitures for further information.",
    "When leased vehicles are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized.",
    "Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to operating expenses as incurred.LeasesWe adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method and used the effective date as the date of initial application.",
    "We elected the “package of practical expedients,” which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.",
    "We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.",
    "We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own.",
    "Right of use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.",
    "ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date.",
    "The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our IBR, because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable.",
    "The IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest the we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis.",
    "Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in our lease liability calculation.",
    "Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs.",
    "Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets.",
    "Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.",
    "For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term.",
    "For finance leases, lease expense is recognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method.",
    "As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, less than 13% and 12% of our operating lease ROU assets related to leased assets were outside of the U.S., respectively.AcquisitionsWe account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”).",
    "The purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.",
    "The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill.",
    "During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.",
    "Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.",
    "Refer to Note 18 – Business Combinations for further information.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination.",
    "We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.",
    "We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.",
    "In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.",
    "If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required.",
    "However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill.",
    "If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary.",
    "However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.",
    "Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.97Intangible Assets, NetIntangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 18 years.",
    "We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment section.",
    "Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.InvestmentsEquity SecuritiesAccounting for our equity securities varies depending on the marketability of the security and the type of investment.",
    "We have elected to measure the majority of our investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment.",
    "This election is reassessed each reporting period to determine whether non-marketable equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for this election.",
    "Equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.",
    "We had no investments in equity securities whose fair value was readily determinable as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.",
    "We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators.",
    "Impairment indicators might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities.",
    "If an impairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment.",
    "We include investments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Debt SecuritiesAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the transaction.",
    "Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially recorded at fair value. Investments in marketable debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds.",
    "Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features are classified as available-for-sale debt securities.",
    "Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
    "We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.",
    "We consider our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets.",
    "Certain investments in non-marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale debt securities are included in investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt SecuritiesWe account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“ASC 326”).",
    "We adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, on a modified retrospective basis.",
    "Under ASC 326, at each reporting period, we evaluate our available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment).",
    "In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost.",
    "In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.",
    "The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.",
    "To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.",
    "A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).",
    "Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
    "Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected.",
    "At December 31, 2020, our investment in Lime Common Stock was our only equity method investments 98for which the fair value option was elected.",
    "Refer to Note 3 - Investments and Fair Value Measurement for further information regarding our 2020 Lime Investments.",
    "Our investments in Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime-1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note (collectively, the “2020 Lime Investments”) are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.",
    "Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost.",
    "Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the entities’ net income or loss and to reflect the amortization of basis differences.",
    "We record our share of the results of equity method investments one quarter in arrears within earnings in equity interests as loss from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations.",
    "We evaluate each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable.",
    "We recognize in the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, any required impairment loss.",
    "Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment.",
    "This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments.Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for ImpairmentWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group (collectively, the “asset group”) may not be recoverable.",
    "We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate.",
    "If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial InstrumentsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.",
    "In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.",
    "The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.",
    "The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below: Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and embedded derivatives and warrants.",
    "The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.",
    "Refer to Note 3 - Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 - Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest EntitiesWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity.",
    "These evaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors.",
    "If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements.",
    "The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE.",
    "Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary.",
    "If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.",
    "Refer to Note 16 - Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\") for further information.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations.",
    "We derive our revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of our platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users.",
    "The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services 99(collectively the “Uber Service”).",
    "Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also generate revenue from end-users we charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services.",
    "Additionally, we derive revenue from customers' use of Freight, and Advanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) and Other Technology Programs.",
    "We periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.Mobility and Delivery AgreementsWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform.",
    "The MSA defines the service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.",
    "The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction.",
    "A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers' and Merchants' ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.In 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets.",
    "In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation to Drivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace.",
    "We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. We present revenue on a net basis for these transactions, as we do not control the service provided by Drivers to end-users.",
    "We recognized total revenue of $323 million associated with these fees charged to end-users for the year ended December 31, 2020.Additionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for delivery services to end-users in those markets.",
    "We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts shall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606.",
    "We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring.",
    "We recognized revenue of $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with these delivery transactions.In all markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users.",
    "As a result, this class of end-users are not our customers.Principal vs. Agent ConsiderationsJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.",
    "We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e.",
    "“gross”), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. “net”).",
    "This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.",
    "For the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions, our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a successful trip or Delivery service to end-users.",
    "We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase or otherwise obtain control of the Drivers' and Merchants' goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to perform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.",
    "As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions.",
    "We are not primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services.",
    "While we facilitate setting the price for Mobility and Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does not result in us controlling the services provided to end-users.In the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting end-users seeking Mobility and Delivery services with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services.",
    "Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfully completed transaction with end-users.",
    "Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing the service to Drivers and Merchants.",
    "In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Delivery People to provide delivery services.",
    "In these markets, we are the principal for the Delivery services and present Delivery revenue on a gross basis because we are primarily responsible for the services.Mobility We derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Riders and successfully complete a trip via the Platform.",
    "We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.",
    "Depending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers.",
    "In markets where we earn the difference 100between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services provided.",
    "Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction.",
    "We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip.In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips.",
    "On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers.",
    "We generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods.",
    "As we currently have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, we concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.",
    "As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until collected from Drivers.Mobility revenue also includes Other revenue primarily from financial partnerships, service fees charged to our Uber for Business (“U4B”) and Vehicle Solutions.",
    "Vehicle Solutions revenue is accounted for as an operating lease as defined under ASC 842 and we recognize revenue from these arrangements as lease payments are collected.",
    "Revenue attributable to this category was not material in all periods presented.DeliveryWe derive our Delivery revenue primarily from service fees paid by Delivery People and Merchants for use of the platform and related service to successfully complete a meal delivery service on the platform.",
    "We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.In the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price.",
    "The service fee paid by Delivery People is the difference between the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Delivery People.",
    "End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while we pay Delivery People based on time and distance for the delivery.",
    "Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction.",
    "We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.FreightWe derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers.",
    "Revenue for Freight represents the gross amount of fees charged to Shippers for these services.",
    "Costs incurred with carriers for Freight transportation are recorded in cost of revenue.Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transport freight.",
    "We enter into contracts with Shippers that define the price for each shipment and payment terms. Our acceptance of the shipment request establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each contract.",
    "By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination.",
    "We enter into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless of payment by the Shipper.",
    "Our sole performance obligation is the transport of Shipper freight using our network of independent freight carriers.",
    "We invoice the Shipper upon satisfaction of the performance obligation.Judgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers.",
    "For each contract entered into with a Shipper, we are responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper's goods.",
    "We therefore control the service before it is transferred to the Shipper.",
    "We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper, including having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrier that meets the Shipper's specifications.",
    "We also have pricing discretion and negotiate separately the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to carriers.",
    "Accordingly, we are the principal in these transactions.In consideration for our Freight services, Shippers pay us a fixed amount for each completed shipment.",
    "When the Shipper's freight reaches its intended destination, our performance obligation is complete.",
    "We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over the period of time a shipment is in transit.",
    "While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are not material.",
    "Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.All Other RevenueE-Bikes and ScootersPrior to the second quarter of 2020, All Other revenue (formerly our Other Bets segment) consisted primarily of revenue from New Mobility products, which were derived from operating leases as defined within ASC 842.",
    "New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (“New Mobility”).",
    "Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We were responsible for providing access to the e-bikes and scooters over the user’s desired period of use.",
    "We recorded lease payments received upon completion of each trip. After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.",
    "Refer to Note 19 - Divestitures for further information on the JUMP Divestiture.101ATG and Other Technology Programs Collaboration RevenueIn 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next–generation self-driving technology.",
    "Under this collaboration agreement, we receive cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition and presentation of the consideration received as collaboration revenue.",
    "Refer to Note 19 - Divestitures for further information.Incentives to Customers Incentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received.",
    "Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive.",
    "Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs.",
    "We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.",
    "We apply the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less.",
    "The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received.",
    "Fair value of the service is established using amounts paid to vendors for similar services.",
    "The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 were $136 million and $103 million, respectively.",
    "Amounts in 2020 were immaterial.In some transactions, incentives and payments made to customers may exceed the revenue earned in the transaction.",
    "In these transactions, the resulting shortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.End-User Discounts and PromotionsWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform.",
    "These are offered in various forms of discounts and promotions and include:Targeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage, or generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon.",
    "An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or meal deliveries during a limited time period.",
    "We record the cost of these discounts and promotions to end-users who are not our customers as sales and marketing expenses at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.End-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platform and the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform.",

    "We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales and marketing expenses at the time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.Market-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants to end-users who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market.",
    "This also includes any discounts offered under our subscription offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable End-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides.",

    "We have no significant financing components in our contracts with customers.102Stock-Based CompensationWe account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of GAAP, which requires compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period.",
    "We account for forfeitures when they occur.",
    "The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques.Service-Based AwardsWe record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (“RSU(s)”) on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years.For stock options with service-based vesting conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model, typically the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates.",
    "We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own shares or comparable publicly traded companies in our industry group.",
    "The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected term.",
    "We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.",
    "We estimate the expected term for non-employees based on the contractual term.",
    "The expected risk-free interest rate is based on the United States (\"U.S.\") Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.",
    "The expected dividend yield is 0.0% as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.Performance-Based AwardsWe have granted restricted common stock awards (“RSA(s)”), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (“SAR(s)”), stock options, and warrants that vest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions.",
    "The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over four years.",

    "We record stock-based compensation expense for performance-based equity awards such as RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, which is generally four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied.Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we had not recognized stock-based compensation expense for awards with performance-based conditions which include a qualifying event because the qualifying event described above had not yet occurred and was not considered probable.",
    "Upon the IPO, we recorded a cumulative one-time stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 billion, determined using the grant-date fair values.",
    "Stock-based compensation related to remaining service-based awards after the IPO is recorded over the remaining requisite service period.",
    "Refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity for further information on our IPO.For performance-based awards and RSUs, we determine the grant-date fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the grant date.For performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model as described above for service-based awards.Market-Based AwardsWe have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based service conditions, performance-based conditions, and market-based conditions.",

    "The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.For market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage.",
    "We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in its industry group.",
    "We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.",
    "Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock and estimated the expected capital raise percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.We record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied.",
    "103We determine the requisite service period by comparing the derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite service period.Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)We recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period.",
    "The ESPP provides for twelve-month offering periods, and each offering period includes two purchase periods of approximately six months.",
    "The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date.",

    "In 2020, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility.",
    "We estimate the expected term based on the contractual term.Common Stock Fair ValueSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair value of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.Prior to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensive business, finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculating stock-based compensation expense.",
    "We obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist the Board of Directors in determining fair value.",
    "These contemporaneous third-party valuations used the methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.",
    "In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered.We account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.",
    "Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence.",
    "Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law.",
    "We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.",
    "Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies.",
    "Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.",
    "We elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (“GILTI”).The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets.",
    "Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and / or discount rates.",
    "The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.",
    "Although we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain.",
    "Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.ExpensesSet forth below is a brief description of the components of our expenses:•Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device 104and service costs, costs incurred for certain Delivery transactions where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Delivery People for services provided, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freight transportation services, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses.•Operations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers.",

    "We record a liability for employee termination benefits either when it is probable that an employee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has communicated the termination plan to employees and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications and their locations, and the expected completion date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.",
    "We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms.",
    "Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognized at the cease-use date.",
    "Costs associated with lease contracts are accounted for under the leasing accounting guidance or under the long-lived assets accounting guidance.Restructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are classified based on our classification policy for each category of operating expense.",
    "Personnel costs are classified based on each employee’s classification, lease costs (including impairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease’s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived assets are recorded within general and administrative expenses.Foreign CurrencyThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S.",
    "dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries’ activities.",
    "Monetary assets and liabilities, and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and are recorded in the current period consolidated statement of operations.",
    "Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities with non-U.S.",
    "dollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year.",
    "Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).105Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common StockholdersWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities.",
    "The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.",
    "Our restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities.",
    "We consider restricted common stock and any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.",
    "Prior to conversion to common stock upon our IPO, the holders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock would have been entitled to dividends in preference to common shareholders, at specified rates, if declared.",
    "Then any remaining earnings would be distributed to the holders of common stock, restricted common stock, common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options, and the holders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock on a pro-rata basis assuming conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock.",
    "These participating securities did not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in our losses.Insurance ReservesWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation.",
    "The insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.",
    "The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.",
    "In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.",
    "These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.",
    "Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.",
    "Reserve amounts estimated to be settled within one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheets.While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.",
    "All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process.",
    "Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided.",
    "Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments.",
    "As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from the estimate provided on the consolidated balance sheets.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the ordinary course of business.",
    "Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.",
    "We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.",
    "If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.We review the developments in contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed.",
    "We make adjustments to provisions and changes to disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.",
    "Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss.The outcome of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain.",
    "Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.We recognize estimated losses from contingencies that relate to proceedings in which Drivers are the plaintiffs, or proceedings and regulatory penalties against Drivers for which we elect to either pay on behalf of or reimburse Drivers, as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.",
    "All other estimated losses from contingencies are recognized in general and administrative expenses.Legal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred.106Pending TransactionJoint Venture Agreement with SK TelecomIn October 2020, we entered into a joint venture agreement with SK Telecom Co., LTD.",

    "Uber paid Google on behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber’s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.",
    "Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.",
    "In March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy.",
    "Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed to perform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC.",
    "The indemnification dispute and Levandowski’s claim will proceed in the bankruptcy court. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from the trade secret conviction.",

    "Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws.",
    "Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction.",
    "In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.",
    "Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.",

    "We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.Also of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr.",
    "Y. Aslam and Mr. J.",
    "Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors.",
    "The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our app was switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016.",

    "We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling.",
    "Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage.",
    "Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring their own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the “worker” classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.",
    "In addition, we expect to be subject to related pension contributions, which will require separate engagement with the UK pension regulator, but the ultimate resolution of this matter, including the amount of any exposure is uncertain.If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties.",

    "We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "As the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic's impact to us worldwide including our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenue, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors.75Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:Payments Due by Period(In millions)TotalLess than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMore than 5 yearsLong-term debt (1)$7,914 $27 $1,120 $3,567 $3,200 Financing obligation (2)851 6 12 13 820 Operating lease commitments (2)3,832 223 634 514 2,461 Finance lease commitments (2)315 189 126 — — Non-cancelable purchase obligations (3)516 187 291 38 — Total contractual obligations$13,428 $632 $2,183 $4,132 $6,481 (1) Refer to Note 8 - Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements of Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our long-term debt obligations.(2) Refer to Note 6 - Leases of Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our operating and finance leases.(3) Consists primarily of non-cancelable commitments for network, data and cloud services, background checks, and other items in the ordinary course of business with varying expiration terms through 2024.The contractual commitment obligations in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.",
    "As of December 31, 2020, we had recorded liabilities of $95 million related to uncertain tax positions.",
    "Due to uncertainties in the timing of potential tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years particularly beyond 12 months.",
    "As a result, this amount is not included in the table above. The table above also excludes approximately $771 million of non-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes related to the acquisition of Careem.",
    "For additional discussion on the acquisition of Careem, see Note 18 – Business Combinations to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations.",
    "An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements.",
    "We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.",
    "Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.",
    "For additional information, see the disclosure included in Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products and Delivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users.",
    "Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or Delivery meal delivery.",
    "Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we have no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Further, judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net).",
    "We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions.",
    "The assessment of 76whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives.",
    "Because we have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips, and because we cannot control whether Drivers will generate future earnings that we can offset to collect our service fee, we have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.",
    "As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver IncentivesIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received.",
    "Driver incentives that are not for a distinct service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the Drivers at the time or as they are earned by the Drivers, depending on the type of Driver incentive.During the fourth quarter of 2020, we changed our accounting policy related to the presentation of cumulative payments to Drivers in excess of cumulative revenue from Drivers.",
    "Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.",
    "For additional information, see Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Referral incentives offered by us and earned by Drivers for performing marketing services of referring other Drivers to drive on our platform are recorded as sales and marketing expense, as we receive a distinct service.",
    "The amount recorded is the lesser of the amount of the Driver incentive paid or the established fair market value of the distinct service received.",
    "Fair market value of the distinct service is estimated using amounts paid to vendors for similar services.End-User Discounts and PromotionsWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform.",
    "These are offered in various forms and include:•Targeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to specific end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage, or generally increase end-users’ use of our platform.",
    "An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or meal deliveries during a limited time period, and are akin to coupons.",
    "We record the cost of these discounts and promotions as sales and marketing expense at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.•End-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platform and the new end-user takes his or her first ride on the platform.",
    "These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring end-user when earned. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to our platform.",
    "We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expense as sales and marketing expense at the time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.•Market-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants to end-users for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market.",
    "Accordingly, we record the cost of these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the trip is completed.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.",
    "The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.",
    "Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.",
    "Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired driver, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and discount rates.Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.",
    "Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.",
    "During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.",
    "Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.77Embedded DerivativesDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting.",
    "These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value.",
    "These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.",
    "We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public Offering (“QIPO”) conversion option (“QIPO Conversion Option”).",
    "The fair value of these convertible notes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPO dates to the valuation date.",
    "The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield, which was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes.",
    "The discount rate is updated during each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.",
    "Upon closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock.",
    "For additional information, refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Investments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt SecuritiesWe hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence.",
    "Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.",
    "Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
    "We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for investments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets.",
    "This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.",
    "In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees’ securities.",
    "In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment.",
    "The impairment analysis for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors.",
    "If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations.",
    "Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost.",
    "In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost.",
    "In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.",
    "The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.",
    "To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.",
    "A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).",
    "Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
    "Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not own a controlling financial interest, using the equity method.",
    "Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost.",
    "Subsequently, we recognize through our consolidated statement of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the entities’ net income or loss and reflect the amortization 78of basis differences.",
    "In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter in arrears.",
    "Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable.",
    "Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential impairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee’s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the investment, among other factors.",
    "If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment.",
    "The fair value determination, particularly for investments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions.",
    "Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment charges.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, non-income tax, or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.",
    "Certain of these matters include claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.",
    "We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.",
    "If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed.",
    "We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.",
    "Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss.",
    "These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and future events.The outcomes of litigation and other disputes are inherently uncertain.",
    "Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions.",
    "We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method.",
    "The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets.",
    "Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and / or discount rates.",
    "The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.",
    "Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain.",
    "Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination.",
    "Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the ongoing impact of the Tax Act, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates.",
    "While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different.",
    "We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit.",
    "To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties.",
    "In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us.",
    "We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.Insurance ReservesWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation.",
    "The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the 79balance sheet date.",
    "The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.",
    "In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.",
    "These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.",
    "Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process.",
    "Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided.",
    "Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments.",
    "As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from the estimated amounts.While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based CompensationWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of our board of directors, and non-employee advisors.",
    "The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees.",
    "The majority of our outstanding RSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity-event based vesting condition.",
    "The service-based vesting condition for the majority of these awards is satisfied over four years.",
    "The liquidity event-based vesting condition is satisfied upon the occurrence of a qualifying event, which is generally defined as a change in control transaction or the effective date of an initial public offering (“IPO”).",
    "Prior to our IPO in May 2019, no qualifying event had occurred, and we did not recognized any stock-based compensation expense for the RSUs and other awards with both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity event-based vesting condition.We account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period.",
    "We account for forfeitures when they occur.We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date.",
    "The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock (see the section titled “-Common Stock Valuations” below), are estimated as follows:•Expected term.",
    "We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.•Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.",
    "Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.•Expected volatility.",
    "We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.•Expected dividend yield.",
    "Expected dividend yield is zero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.We continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculation on a prospective basis.",
    "As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected term, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",
    "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business.",
    "These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:Interest Rate RiskOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2016 Term Loan Facility and our 2018 Term Loan Facility.",
    "The 2016 Term Loan Facility and 2018 Term Loan Facility are floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements.",
    "A rising interest rate environment will 80increase the amount of interest paid on these loans.",
    "A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the results of our operations.The fair value of our fixed rate notes and 2025 Convertible Notes outstanding will generally fluctuate with movements in interest rates and the market price of our stock.",
    "A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $271 million as of December 31, 2020.Investment Risk Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk.",
    "We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $12.1 billion and $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.",
    "Marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S.",
    "government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.",
    "Our investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments.",
    "A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest income by $22 million and $97 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively.",
    "A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our marketable debt securities portfolio.We have significant risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned affiliates, as all of our investments are currently in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information.",
    "As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our investments was $10.1 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies.",
    "Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.",
    "We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.",
    "Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.",
    "Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S.",
    "dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.",
    "Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.",

    "The acquired entities are wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent approximately 1% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
    "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 83prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
    "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
    "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue and Related Discounts and PromotionsAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of the Company’s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services.",
    "Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.",
    "This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.",
    "The Company’s Mobility and Delivery revenue was $9,993 million and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue and related discounts and promotions is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis, analyzing the role of the Company in the transactions and the related transaction attributes, including the type of discounts and promotions applied, utilized or earned by the end-user in the transaction and assessing their presentation, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing our audit procedures to evaluate whether transaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
    "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s revenue recognition process, including controls over the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue and discounts and promotions.",
    "These procedures also included, among others, testing, on sample basis, trip transaction attributes and assessing management’s classification by evaluating the Company’s role in the transaction, examining documentation related to arrangement terms, driver statements and rider receipts, discounts and promotions and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on revenue presentation and income statement classification.Valuation of Insurance ReservesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.",
    "The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.",
    "In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.",
    "These reserves are continually reviewed by management and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.",
    "As disclosed by management, the Company’s insurance reserves as of December 31, 2020 were $3,466 million.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing their estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the various actuarial methods and the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs.",
    "Also, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
    "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s valuation of insurance reserves, including controls over the development of the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs.",
    "These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) developing, for selected reserve components, an independent actuarial estimate of the insurance reserves, and comparison of this independent estimate to management’s actuarially determined reserves, and (ii) testing, for other selected reserve components, management’s process for estimating the insurance reserves.",
    "Developing the independent estimate 84involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and independently developing the loss development patterns and expected loss costs.",
    "Testing management’s process for estimating the insurance reserves involved evaluating the appropriateness of management’s actuarial methods, evaluating the reasonableness of the loss development patterns and expected loss costs used in those methods, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Francisco, CaliforniaMarch 1, 2021We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.85UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts)As of December 31, 2019As of December 31, 2020AssetsCash and cash equivalents$10,873 $5,647 Short-term investments440 1,180 Restricted cash and cash equivalents99 250 Accounts receivable, net of allowance of $34 and $55, respectively1,214 1,073 Prepaid expenses and other current assets1,299 1,215 Assets held for sale— 517 Total current assets13,925 9,882 Restricted cash and cash equivalents1,095 1,494 Collateral held by insurer1,199 860 Investments (including amortized cost of debt securities of $2,279 and $2,281)10,527 9,052 Equity method investments1,364 1,079 Property and equipment, net1,731 1,814 Operating lease right-of-use assets1,594 1,274 Intangible assets, net71 1,564 Goodwill167 6,109 Other assets88 124 Total assets$31,761 $33,252 Liabilities, mezzanine equity and equityAccounts payable$272 $235 Short-term insurance reserves1,121 1,243 Operating lease liabilities, current196 175 Accrued and other current liabilities4,050 5,112 Liabilities held for sale— 100 Total current liabilities5,639 6,865 Long-term insurance reserves2,297 2,223 Long-term debt, net of current portion5,707 7,560 Operating lease liabilities, non-current1,523 1,544 Other long-term liabilities1,412 1,306 Total liabilities16,578 19,498 Commitments and contingencies (Note 15)Mezzanine equityRedeemable non-controlling interests311 787 EquityCommon stock, $0.00001 par value, 5,000,000 shares authorized for both periods, 1,716,681 and 1,849,794 shares issued and outstanding, respectively— — Additional paid-in capital30,739 35,931 Accumulated other comprehensive loss(187)(535)Accumulated deficit(16,362)(23,130)Total Uber Technologies, Inc.",

    "Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.As our business has evolved, we believe our new presentation policy is preferable as it better reflects the financial performance of transactions with customers across all of our businesses and provides more clarity about changes in both revenue and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, resulting in improved financial reporting and alignment with financial information used internally by management.",

    "Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.",
    "On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: the incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) applied in lease accounting; fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; 94insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities.",

    "The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations and financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration.",

    "We elected the “package of practical expedients,” which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.",
    "We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.",
    "We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own.",
    "Right of use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.",
    "ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date.",

    "In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.",
    "If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required.",
    "However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill.",
    "If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary.",

    "Equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.",
    "We had no investments in equity securities whose fair value was readily determinable as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.",
    "We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators.",
    "Impairment indicators might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities.",
    "If an impairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment.",
    "We include investments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Debt SecuritiesAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the transaction.",
    "Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially recorded at fair value. Investments in marketable debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds.",
    "Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features are classified as available-for-sale debt securities.",
    "Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
    "We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.",
    "We consider our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets.",
    "Certain investments in non-marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale debt securities are included in investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt SecuritiesWe account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“ASC 326”).",
    "We adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, on a modified retrospective basis.",
    "Under ASC 326, at each reporting period, we evaluate our available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment).",
    "In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost.",
    "In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.",
    "The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.",
    "To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.",
    "A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).",
    "Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
    "Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected.",
    "At December 31, 2020, our investment in Lime Common Stock was our only equity method investments 98for which the fair value option was elected.",
    "Refer to Note 3 - Investments and Fair Value Measurement for further information regarding our 2020 Lime Investments.",
    "Our investments in Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime-1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note (collectively, the “2020 Lime Investments”) are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.",
    "Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost.",
    "Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the entities’ net income or loss and to reflect the amortization of basis differences.",
    "We record our share of the results of equity method investments one quarter in arrears within earnings in equity interests as loss from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations.",
    "We evaluate each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable.",
    "We recognize in the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, any required impairment loss.",
    "Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment.",
    "This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments.Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for ImpairmentWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group (collectively, the “asset group”) may not be recoverable.",
    "We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate.",
    "If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial InstrumentsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.",
    "In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.",
    "The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.",
    "The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below: Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and embedded derivatives and warrants.",
    "The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.",
    "Refer to Note 3 - Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 - Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest EntitiesWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity.",
    "These evaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors.",
    "If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements.",
    "The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE.",
    "Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary.",
    "If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.",
    "Refer to Note 16 - Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\") for further information.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations.",
    "We derive our revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of our platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users.",
    "The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services 99(collectively the “Uber Service”).",
    "Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also generate revenue from end-users we charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services.",
    "Additionally, we derive revenue from customers' use of Freight, and Advanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) and Other Technology Programs.",
    "We periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.Mobility and Delivery AgreementsWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform.",
    "The MSA defines the service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.",
    "The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction.",
    "A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers' and Merchants' ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.In 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets.",
    "In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation to Drivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace.",
    "We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. We present revenue on a net basis for these transactions, as we do not control the service provided by Drivers to end-users.",
    "We recognized total revenue of $323 million associated with these fees charged to end-users for the year ended December 31, 2020.Additionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for delivery services to end-users in those markets.",
    "We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts shall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606.",
    "We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring.",
    "We recognized revenue of $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with these delivery transactions.In all markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users.",
    "As a result, this class of end-users are not our customers.Principal vs. Agent ConsiderationsJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.",
    "We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e.",
    "“gross”), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. “net”).",
    "This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.",
    "For the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions, our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a successful trip or Delivery service to end-users.",
    "We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase or otherwise obtain control of the Drivers' and Merchants' goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to perform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.",
    "As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions.",
    "We are not primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services.",
    "While we facilitate setting the price for Mobility and Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does not result in us controlling the services provided to end-users.In the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting end-users seeking Mobility and Delivery services with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services.",
    "Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfully completed transaction with end-users.",
    "Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing the service to Drivers and Merchants.",
    "In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Delivery People to provide delivery services.",
    "In these markets, we are the principal for the Delivery services and present Delivery revenue on a gross basis because we are primarily responsible for the services.Mobility We derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Riders and successfully complete a trip via the Platform.",
    "We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.",
    "Depending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers.",
    "In markets where we earn the difference 100between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services provided.",
    "Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction.",
    "We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip.In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips.",
    "On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers.",
    "We generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods.",
    "As we currently have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, we concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.",
    "As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until collected from Drivers.Mobility revenue also includes Other revenue primarily from financial partnerships, service fees charged to our Uber for Business (“U4B”) and Vehicle Solutions.",
    "Vehicle Solutions revenue is accounted for as an operating lease as defined under ASC 842 and we recognize revenue from these arrangements as lease payments are collected.",
    "Revenue attributable to this category was not material in all periods presented.DeliveryWe derive our Delivery revenue primarily from service fees paid by Delivery People and Merchants for use of the platform and related service to successfully complete a meal delivery service on the platform.",
    "We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.In the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price.",
    "The service fee paid by Delivery People is the difference between the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Delivery People.",
    "End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while we pay Delivery People based on time and distance for the delivery.",
    "Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction.",
    "We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.FreightWe derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers.",
    "Revenue for Freight represents the gross amount of fees charged to Shippers for these services.",
    "Costs incurred with carriers for Freight transportation are recorded in cost of revenue.Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transport freight.",
    "We enter into contracts with Shippers that define the price for each shipment and payment terms. Our acceptance of the shipment request establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each contract.",
    "By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination.",
    "We enter into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless of payment by the Shipper.",
    "Our sole performance obligation is the transport of Shipper freight using our network of independent freight carriers.",
    "We invoice the Shipper upon satisfaction of the performance obligation.Judgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers.",
    "For each contract entered into with a Shipper, we are responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper's goods.",
    "We therefore control the service before it is transferred to the Shipper.",
    "We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper, including having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrier that meets the Shipper's specifications.",
    "We also have pricing discretion and negotiate separately the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to carriers.",
    "Accordingly, we are the principal in these transactions.In consideration for our Freight services, Shippers pay us a fixed amount for each completed shipment.",
    "When the Shipper's freight reaches its intended destination, our performance obligation is complete.",
    "We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over the period of time a shipment is in transit.",

    "Refer to Note 19 - Divestitures for further information.Incentives to Customers Incentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received.",
    "Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive.",
    "Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs.",
    "We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.",
    "We apply the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less.",
    "The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received.",

    "These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring end-user. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform.",
    "We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales and marketing expenses at the time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.Market-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants to end-users who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market.",
    "This also includes any discounts offered under our subscription offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable End-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides.",

    "We account for forfeitures when they occur.",
    "The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques.Service-Based AwardsWe record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (“RSU(s)”) on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years.For stock options with service-based vesting conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model, typically the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates.",
    "We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own shares or comparable publicly traded companies in our industry group.",
    "The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected term.",
    "We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.",
    "We estimate the expected term for non-employees based on the contractual term.",
    "The expected risk-free interest rate is based on the United States (\"U.S.\") Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.",
    "The expected dividend yield is 0.0% as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.Performance-Based AwardsWe have granted restricted common stock awards (“RSA(s)”), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (“SAR(s)”), stock options, and warrants that vest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions.",
    "The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over four years.",
    "The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as our financial or operating metrics, and/or the occurrence of a qualifying event, defined as the earlier of (i) the closing of certain specific liquidation or change in control transactions, or (ii) an initial public offering (“IPO”).",
    "We record stock-based compensation expense for performance-based equity awards such as RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, which is generally four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied.Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we had not recognized stock-based compensation expense for awards with performance-based conditions which include a qualifying event because the qualifying event described above had not yet occurred and was not considered probable.",
    "Upon the IPO, we recorded a cumulative one-time stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 billion, determined using the grant-date fair values.",
    "Stock-based compensation related to remaining service-based awards after the IPO is recorded over the remaining requisite service period.",
    "Refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity for further information on our IPO.For performance-based awards and RSUs, we determine the grant-date fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the grant date.For performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model as described above for service-based awards.Market-Based AwardsWe have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based service conditions, performance-based conditions, and market-based conditions.",
    "The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over four years.",
    "The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-based awards.",
    "The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.For market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage.",
    "We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in its industry group.",
    "We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.",
    "Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock and estimated the expected capital raise percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.We record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied.",
    "103We determine the requisite service period by comparing the derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite service period.Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)We recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period.",
    "The ESPP provides for twelve-month offering periods, and each offering period includes two purchase periods of approximately six months.",
    "The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date.",
    "We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under the ESPP based on a combination of options valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.",
    "In 2019, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months based on our historical volatility and twelve months based on the average of our historical volatility and our peer group.",
    "In 2020, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility.",
    "We estimate the expected term based on the contractual term.Common Stock Fair ValueSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair value of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.Prior to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensive business, finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculating stock-based compensation expense.",
    "We obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist the Board of Directors in determining fair value.",
    "These contemporaneous third-party valuations used the methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.",
    "In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered.We account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.",
    "Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence.",
    "Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law.",
    "We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.",
    "Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies.",
    "Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.",
    "We elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (“GILTI”).The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets.",
    "Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and / or discount rates.",
    "The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.",
    "Although we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain.",
    "Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.ExpensesSet forth below is a brief description of the components of our expenses:•Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device 104and service costs, costs incurred for certain Delivery transactions where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Delivery People for services provided, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freight transportation services, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses.•Operations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers.",

    "General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.•Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, leased vehicles, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.Restructuring and Related ChargesCosts associated with management-approved restructuring activities, including reductions in headcount, exiting a market or consolidation of facilities are recognized when they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-lived assets (including impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease cost for right-of-use assets that ceased to be used.",
    "We record a liability for employee termination benefits either when it is probable that an employee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has communicated the termination plan to employees and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications and their locations, and the expected completion date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.",
    "We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms.",
    "Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognized at the cease-use date.",
    "Costs associated with lease contracts are accounted for under the leasing accounting guidance or under the long-lived assets accounting guidance.Restructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are classified based on our classification policy for each category of operating expense.",
    "Personnel costs are classified based on each employee’s classification, lease costs (including impairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease’s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived assets are recorded within general and administrative expenses.Foreign CurrencyThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S.",
    "dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries’ activities.",
    "Monetary assets and liabilities, and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and are recorded in the current period consolidated statement of operations.",
    "Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities with non-U.S.",
    "dollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year.",
    "Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).105Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common StockholdersWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities.",
    "The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.",
    "Our restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities.",
    "We consider restricted common stock and any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.",
    "Prior to conversion to common stock upon our IPO, the holders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock would have been entitled to dividends in preference to common shareholders, at specified rates, if declared.",
    "Then any remaining earnings would be distributed to the holders of common stock, restricted common stock, common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options, and the holders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock on a pro-rata basis assuming conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock.",
    "These participating securities did not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in our losses.Insurance ReservesWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation.",
    "The insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.",
    "The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.",
    "In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.",
    "These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.",
    "Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.",
    "Reserve amounts estimated to be settled within one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheets.While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.",
    "All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process.",
    "Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided.",
    "Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments.",
    "As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from the estimate provided on the consolidated balance sheets.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the ordinary course of business.",
    "Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.",
    "We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.",
    "If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.We review the developments in contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed.",
    "We make adjustments to provisions and changes to disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.",
    "Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss.The outcome of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain.",
    "Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.We recognize estimated losses from contingencies that relate to proceedings in which Drivers are the plaintiffs, or proceedings and regulatory penalties against Drivers for which we elect to either pay on behalf of or reimburse Drivers, as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.",
    "All other estimated losses from contingencies are recognized in general and administrative expenses.Legal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred.106Pending TransactionJoint Venture Agreement with SK TelecomIn October 2020, we entered into a joint venture agreement with SK Telecom Co., LTD.",

    "As a result, the carrying value of the investment in Grab was reduced by $230 million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million, representing the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding credit-related impairment charge recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.",
    "Due to the significant uncertainty about Grab’s ability to repay the redemption amount of the securities on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected was considered to be less than the fair value of the securities.",

    "As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising from COVID-19, we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, was less than their carrying value.",
    "112To determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM, weighted at 80% and 20%, respectively.",
    "The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario, where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees’ capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences.",
    "We computed a range of market adjustments based on observed market valuation declines of Didi’s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securities occurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services.",
    "These inputs are considered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity.",
    "Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from the latest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.",
    "A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes of allocating value in the OPM approach.",
    "The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event would result in higher valuation (due to access to public markets and reduction in cost of capital), reduces valuation uncertainty, and generally assumes market and macro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario.",
