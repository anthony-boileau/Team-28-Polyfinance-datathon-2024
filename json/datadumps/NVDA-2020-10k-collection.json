    "On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill.",
    "We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.",
    "The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.InventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis.",
    "We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory.",
    "Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition.",
    "In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019.",
    "The charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess DRAM, other components, and prior architecture components and chips.",
    "As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand.",
    "In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints.",
    "We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing.",
    "We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.26Table of ContentsProduct Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products.",
    "Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.",
    "However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.",
    "We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components.",
    "As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed.",
    "We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.",
    "If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Income TaxesWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction.",
    "We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.",
    "Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances.",
    "In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due.",
    "If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As of January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes.",
    "To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position.",
    "Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment.",
    "Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value.",
    "We have identified two reporting units, 27Table of ContentsGPU and Tegra Processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis.",
    "Goodwill assigned to the GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units as of January 26, 2020 was $210 million and $408 million, respectively.",
    "Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.",
    "We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units.",
    "We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment.Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Results of OperationsA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 is presented below.",

    "federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.",
    "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.",
    "Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
    "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.",

    "We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
    "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management 37Table of Contentsand directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
    "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
    "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete InventoriesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory.",
    "Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.",
    "Management applies significant judgment in the valuation of inventories, which involves estimating future demand and market conditions.",
    "As of January 26, 2020, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $979 million.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when developing their provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
    "This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures over the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, which included evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
    "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
    "These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
    "Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaFebruary 20, 2020We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004.",

Accounting PoliciesOur CompanyHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.",
    "All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.Fiscal YearWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January.",
    "Fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 52-week years.",
    "Fiscal year 2021 will be a 53-week year.ReclassificationsCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.Principles of ConsolidationOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.",
    "All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.",
    "GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.",
    "Actual results could differ materially from our estimates.",
    "On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies.",
    "These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing.",
    "We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products.",
    "Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.",
    "However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.",
    "We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.45Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components.",
    "As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed.",
    "We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.",
    "If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.Software LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer.",
    "Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.",
    "Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS.",
    "For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation.",
    "Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer.",
    "PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Advertising ExpensesWe expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred.",
    "Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $15 million, $21 million, and $25 million, respectively.",
    "Product WarrantiesWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures.",
    "Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition.",
    "Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products.",
    "We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.Stock-based CompensationWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs.",
    "We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs.",
    "The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model.",
    "We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year.",
    "Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model.",
    "Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Litigation, Investigation and Settlement CostsFrom time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies.",
    "There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments.",
    "If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S.",
    "GAAP.",
    "However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.Foreign Currency RemeasurementWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries.",
    "Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates.",
    "Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.",
    "Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates.",
    "Gains or losses from foreign currency 46Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.Income TaxesWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction.",
    "We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.",
    "Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances.",
    "In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due.",
    "If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As of January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes.",
    "To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position.",
    "Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Net Income Per ShareBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.",
    "Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method.",
    "Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive.",
    "Cash and Cash EquivalentsWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.",
    "Marketable SecuritiesMarketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale.",
    "These debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax.",
    "The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest.",
    "Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.",
    "Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review.",
    "We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary or have other indicators of impairments.",
    "If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument.",
    "In these situations, we recognize an 47Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value.",
    "For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors.",
    "The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019.",
    "Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax.",
    "Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value.",
    "The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.",
    "For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged.",
    "For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings.",
    "For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable.",
    "Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration.",
    "Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable, was approximately 21% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 26, 2020 and 19% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 27, 2019.",
    "We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses.",
    "This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure.",
    "Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.Accounts ReceivableWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.",
    "We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure.",
    "Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit.InventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis.",
    "Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts.",
    "We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory.",
    "Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.",
    "Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost.",
    "Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years.",
    "Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded.",
    "The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.",
    "Depreciation expense includes the amortization 48Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)of assets recorded under capital leases.",
    "Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.LeasesWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception.",
    "Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.",
    "Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate.",
    "Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives.",
    "Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.",
    "Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist.",
    "For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.",
    "Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units.",
    "Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value.",
    "The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.",
    "Refer to Note 6 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.",
    "Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsIntangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property, trademarks and customer relationships.",
    "We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.",
    "Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.",
    "Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group.",
    "If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group.",
    "Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group.",
    "Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases under which lease assets and liabilities are recognized on the balance sheet.",
    "We adopted this guidance on January 49Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)28, 2019 using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet.",
    "Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.",
    "We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities.",
    "We plan to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.",
    "We do not currently believe it will have a material impact upon adoption.Note 2 - Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement.",
    "The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants.",
    "The consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of Mellanox shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement.",
    "In June 2019, Mellanox shareholders approved the consummation of the merger and we received regulatory approvals for the deal from Mexico in July 2019 and from the European Commission in December 2019.",
    "In addition, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the proposed acquisition expired in May 2019.",
    "Discussions with China's regulatory agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, are progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020.",
    "If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million.Note 3 - New Lease Accounting StandardMethod and Impact of AdoptionOn January 28, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet and not adjusting comparative information for prior periods.",
    "In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed us not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases.",
    "The cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $470 million of operating lease assets and $500 million of operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.",
    "The difference of $30 million represents deferred rent for leases that existed as of the date of adoption, which was an offset to the opening balance of operating lease assets.Lease ObligationsOur lease obligations consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2021 and 2035.50Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)Future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of January 26, 2020, are as follows: Operating Lease Obligations (In millions)Fiscal Year: 2021 $121202211720231022024792025622026 and thereafter292Total773Less imputed interest121Present value of net future minimum lease payments652Less short-term operating lease liabilities91Long-term operating lease liabilities$561Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 27, 2019, based on the previous lease accounting standard, are as follows: Lease Obligations (In millions)Fiscal Year: 2020$1002021972022902023772024542025 and thereafter265Total$683Operating lease expense for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $114 million, $80 million, $54 million, respectively.",

    "We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory.",
    "Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition.",
    "In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019.",
    "The charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess DRAM, other components, and prior architecture components and chips.",
    "As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand.",
    "In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints.",
    "We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing.",
    "We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.26Table of ContentsProduct Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products.",
    "Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.",
    "However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.",
    "We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components.",

    "We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.",
    "Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances.",
    "In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due.",
    "If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As of January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes.",
    "To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position.",
    "Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment.",

    "Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.",
    "The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.InventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis.",
    "We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory.",
    "Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition.",
    "In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019.",
    "The charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess DRAM, other components, and prior architecture components and chips.",
    "As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand.",
    "In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints.",

    "We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.26Table of ContentsProduct Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products.",
    "Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.",
    "However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.",
    "We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components.",
    "As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed.",
    "We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.",

    "We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.",
    "Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances.",
    "In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due.",
    "If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As of January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes.",
    "To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position.",

    "federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.",
    "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.",
    "Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
    "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.",
    "Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.",
    "We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
    "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management 37Table of Contentsand directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
    "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
    "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete InventoriesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory.",
    "Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.",
    "Management applies significant judgment in the valuation of inventories, which involves estimating future demand and market conditions.",
    "As of January 26, 2020, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $979 million.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when developing their provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
    "This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures over the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, which included evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
    "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
    "These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
    "Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaFebruary 20, 2020We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004.",

    "Fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 52-week years.",
    "Fiscal year 2021 will be a 53-week year.ReclassificationsCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.Principles of ConsolidationOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.",
    "All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.",
    "GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.",
    "Actual results could differ materially from our estimates.",
    "On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies.",
    "These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing.",
    "We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products.",
    "Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.",
    "However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.",
    "We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.45Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components.",
    "As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed.",
    "We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.",
    "If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.Software LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer.",
    "Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.",
    "Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS.",

    "In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.",
    "Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Change in Accounting PrincipleAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in fiscal year 2020.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.",
    "Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.",
    "We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.",
    "federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.",
    "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.",
    "Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
    "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.",
    "Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.",
    "We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
    "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management 37Table of Contentsand directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
    "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
    "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete InventoriesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory.",
    "Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.",
    "Management applies significant judgment in the valuation of inventories, which involves estimating future demand and market conditions.",
    "As of January 26, 2020, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $979 million.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when developing their provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
    "This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures over the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, which included evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
    "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
    "These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.",
    "Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaFebruary 20, 2020We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004.",

Accounting PoliciesOur CompanyHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.",
    "All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.Fiscal YearWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January.",
    "Fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 52-week years.",
    "Fiscal year 2021 will be a 53-week year.ReclassificationsCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.Principles of ConsolidationOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.",
    "All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.",
    "GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.",
    "Actual results could differ materially from our estimates.",
    "On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies.",
    "These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing.",
    "We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products.",
    "Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.",
    "However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.",
    "We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.45Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components.",
    "As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed.",
    "We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.",
    "If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.Software LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer.",
    "Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.",
    "Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS.",
    "For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation.",
    "Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer.",
    "PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Advertising ExpensesWe expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred.",
    "Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $15 million, $21 million, and $25 million, respectively.",
    "Product WarrantiesWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures.",
    "Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition.",
    "Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products.",
    "We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.Stock-based CompensationWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs.",
    "We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs.",
    "The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model.",
    "We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year.",
    "Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model.",
    "Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Litigation, Investigation and Settlement CostsFrom time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies.",
    "There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments.",
    "If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S.",
    "GAAP.",
    "However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.Foreign Currency RemeasurementWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries.",
    "Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates.",
    "Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.",
    "Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates.",
    "Gains or losses from foreign currency 46Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.Income TaxesWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction.",
    "We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.",
    "Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances.",
    "In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due.",
    "If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As of January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes.",
    "To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position.",
    "Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Net Income Per ShareBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.",
    "Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method.",
    "Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive.",
    "Cash and Cash EquivalentsWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.",
    "Marketable SecuritiesMarketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale.",
    "These debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax.",
    "The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest.",
    "Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.",
    "Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review.",
    "We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary or have other indicators of impairments.",
    "If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument.",
    "In these situations, we recognize an 47Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized cost basis and its fair value.",
    "For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors.",
    "The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019.",
    "Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax.",
    "Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value.",
    "The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.",
    "For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged.",
    "For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings.",
    "For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable.",
    "Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration.",
    "Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable, was approximately 21% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 26, 2020 and 19% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 27, 2019.",
