        "See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.50TABLE OF CONTENTSProduction costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).With respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance.",
        "Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance.",
        "Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort.",
        "Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms.",
        "Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year.",
        "If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment.",
        "Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
        "The determination of projected usage requires judgment and is reviewed on a regular basis for changes. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change.",
        "For example, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, for certain content, we are accelerating the rate of amortization in early periods, slowing the rate in later periods and have adjusted the useful life based on historical and projected usage patterns.",
        "The most sensitive factors affecting projected usage are historical and estimated viewing patterns.",
        "If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.For content that is predominantly monetized as a group, the aggregate unamortized costs of the group are compared to the present value of the discounted cash flows using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content.",
        "If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group.",
        "If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written-off immediately.",
        "Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of assessing recoverability.The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on projections of revenues for each season relative to projections of total revenues over the contract period (estimated relative value).",
        "Projected revenues include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue.",
        "If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.",
        "If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.Revenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business.",
        "Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions.",
        "Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually.",
        "Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date.",
        "A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate.",
        "We increased our discount rate to 5.44% at the end of fiscal 2022 from 2.88% at the end of fiscal 2021 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2022 year-end measurement date.",
        "The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves.",
        "A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2023 by approximately $242 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 1, 2022 by approximately $2.3 billion.",
        "A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $59 million and $2.0 billion, respectively.51TABLE OF CONTENTSTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class.",
        "Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense.",
        "A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2023 annual expense by approximately $172 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
        "The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
        "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
        "The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.",
        "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2022, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
        "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
        "We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
        "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
        "In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.",
        "We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.",
        "If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
        "The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows.",
        "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.",
        "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
        "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
        "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
        "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses.",
        "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
        "Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.52TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company has investments in equity securities.",
        "For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments.",
        "If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.",
        "The fiscal 2022 charges primarily related to our businesses in Russia.",
        "The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.Allowance for Credit LossesWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.",
        "In times of economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods.",
        "If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.",
        "See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings.",
        "These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate.",
        "From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss.",
        "It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters.",
        "See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income TaxAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.",
        "From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments.",
        "Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities.",
        "The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.ITEM 7A.",
        "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.Policies and ProceduresIn the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs.",
        "To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings.",
        "By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges.",

        "The economic or political conditions in certain countries have reduced and in the future could further reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in, or repatriate cash from, those countries.Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes.",
        "The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.Our objectives in managing exposures to market-based fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities.",

        "The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation.",
        "The Company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique).",
        "These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end.",

        "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",

        "Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually is amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",
        "For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used by the Company’s DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films.",
        "For episodic television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on the Company’s DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.",
        "Production costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage (which may be, for example, derived from historical viewership patterns), typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
        "For the year ended October 1, 2022, the Company recognized $10,224 million of amortization of produced content costs, which is primarily included in “Cost of services” in the consolidated statements of operations.",
        "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of production costs is a critical audit matter are the significant auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence used in the amortization calculation for production costs monetized individually and as a group, and management’s estimates of Ultimate Revenues and projected usage.",
        "Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
        "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to amortization of production costs, including controls over the estimation of Ultimate Revenues and projected usage.",
        "These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining the amortization of production costs, (ii) evaluating whether ultimate revenues for certain content titles were reasonable considering information such as past performance of comparable titles, future firm commitments to license programs, and current market trends, (iii) evaluating the accelerated amortization pattern for content predominately monetized as a group, and (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the amortization calculation for certain titles and for historical viewership data used to calculate the estimate of projected usage for certain groups./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPLos Angeles, CaliforniaNovember 29, 2022 We have served as

        "The predominant monetization strategy for content released prior to the beginning of fiscal 2020 (the date the Company adopted accounting guidance that was applied prospectively) was determined based on the expected means of monetization over the remaining life of the content.",
        "Thus for example, film titles that were released theatrically and in home entertainment prior to fiscal year 2020 and are now distributed on Disney+ are generally considered group content.The classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title’s monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g.",
        "content that was initially intended for license to a third party is instead used on an owned DTC service).",

        "Fixed non-lease costs, for example common-area maintenance costs, are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived AssetsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
        "The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
        "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
        "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2022, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
        "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
        "We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
        "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
        "In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.",
        "We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.",
        "If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair 82TABLE OF CONTENTSvalue.",

        "The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our FCC licenses and trademarks, which are our most significant indefinite-lived intangible assets.Finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods up to 40 years.",
        "The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
        "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
        "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses.",
        "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",

        "The Company primarily enters into two types of derivatives: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure.",
        "Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment.",
        "Hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g.",
        "forecasted revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g.",
        "floating-rate debt).The Company designates and assigns the derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities.",
        "When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged occur or are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated derivatives.83TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company’s hedge positions are measured at fair value on the balance sheet.",
        "Realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged.",
        "The Company accrues the differential for interest rate swaps to be paid or received under the agreements as interest rates change as adjustments to interest expense over the lives of the swaps.",
        "Gains and losses on the termination of effective swap agreements, prior to their original maturity, are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying hedged transactions.The Company enters into derivatives that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting.",
        "These derivatives are intended to offset certain economic exposures of the Company and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings.",
        "Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under the same category as the cash flows from the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions (see Notes 8 and 17).Income TaxesDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded with respect to temporary differences in the accounting treatment of items for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes.",
        "Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount that, in management’s judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.A tax position must meet a minimum probability threshold before a financial statement benefit is recognized.",
        "The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.",
        "The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsThe Company consolidates the results of certain subsidiaries that are less than 100% owned and for which the noncontrolling interest shareholders have the rights to require the Company to purchase their interests in these subsidiaries.",
        "The most significant of these are Hulu LLC (Hulu) and BAMTech LLC (BAMTech).Hulu provides DTC streaming services and is owned 67% by the Company and 33% by NBC Universal (NBCU).",

        "For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group.",
        "See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.50TABLE OF CONTENTSProduction costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).With respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance.",
        "Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance.",
        "Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort.",
        "Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms.",
        "Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year.",
        "If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment.",
        "Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
        "The determination of projected usage requires judgment and is reviewed on a regular basis for changes. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change.",
        "For example, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, for certain content, we are accelerating the rate of amortization in early periods, slowing the rate in later periods and have adjusted the useful life based on historical and projected usage patterns.",
        "The most sensitive factors affecting projected usage are historical and estimated viewing patterns.",
        "If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.For content that is predominantly monetized as a group, the aggregate unamortized costs of the group are compared to the present value of the discounted cash flows using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content.",
        "If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group.",
        "If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written-off immediately.",
        "Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of assessing recoverability.The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on projections of revenues for each season relative to projections of total revenues over the contract period (estimated relative value).",
        "Projected revenues include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue.",
        "If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.",
        "If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.Revenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business.",
        "Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions.",
        "Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually.",
        "Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date.",
        "A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate.",
        "We increased our discount rate to 5.44% at the end of fiscal 2022 from 2.88% at the end of fiscal 2021 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2022 year-end measurement date.",
        "The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves.",
        "A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2023 by approximately $242 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 1, 2022 by approximately $2.3 billion.",
        "A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $59 million and $2.0 billion, respectively.51TABLE OF CONTENTSTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class.",
        "Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense.",
        "A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2023 annual expense by approximately $172 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
        "The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
        "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
        "The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.",
        "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2022, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
        "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
        "We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
        "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
        "In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.",
        "We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.",
        "If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
        "The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows.",
        "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.",
        "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
        "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
        "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
        "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses.",
        "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
        "Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.52TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company has investments in equity securities.",
        "For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments.",
        "If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.",
        "The fiscal 2022 charges primarily related to our businesses in Russia.",
        "The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.Allowance for Credit LossesWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.",
        "In times of economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods.",
        "If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.",
        "See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings.",
        "These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate.",
        "From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss.",
        "It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters.",
        "See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income TaxAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.",
        "From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments.",
        "Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities.",
        "The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements."

        "The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures.",
        "The economic or political conditions in certain countries have reduced and in the future could further reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in, or repatriate cash from, those countries.Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes.",
        "The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.Our objectives in managing exposures to market-based fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities.",

        "The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.Value at Risk (VAR)The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments.",
        "The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation.",
        "The Company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique).",
        "These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end.",

        "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",

        "Production costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage (which may be, for example, derived from historical viewership patterns), typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
        "For the year ended October 1, 2022, the Company recognized $10,224 million of amortization of produced content costs, which is primarily included in “Cost of services” in the consolidated statements of operations.",
        "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of production costs is a critical audit matter are the significant auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence used in the amortization calculation for production costs monetized individually and as a group, and management’s estimates of Ultimate Revenues and projected usage.",
        "Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
        "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to amortization of production costs, including controls over the estimation of Ultimate Revenues and projected usage.",
        "These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining the amortization of production costs, (ii) evaluating whether ultimate revenues for certain content titles were reasonable considering information such as past performance of comparable titles, future firm commitments to license programs, and current market trends, (iii) evaluating the accelerated amortization pattern for content predominately monetized as a group, and (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the amortization calculation for certain titles and for historical viewership data used to calculate the estimate of projected usage for certain groups./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPLos Angeles, CaliforniaNovember 29, 2022 We have served as

        "We generally classify content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees as individual assets.",
        "The predominant monetization strategy for content released prior to the beginning of fiscal 2020 (the date the Company adopted accounting guidance that was applied prospectively) was determined based on the expected means of monetization over the remaining life of the content.",
        "Thus for example, film titles that were released theatrically and in home entertainment prior to fiscal year 2020 and are now distributed on Disney+ are generally considered group content.The classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title’s monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g.",
        "content that was initially intended for license to a third party is instead used on an owned DTC service).",

        "Participations and residuals are expensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.Production costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage, generally resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
        "Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change.",
        "Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.Licensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our Linear Networks or DTC streaming services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate.",

        "If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.Acquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition.",
        "Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, except it excludes the prior seasons of episodic television programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.Amortization of capitalized costs for produced and acquired content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services.",

        "To the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.",
        "For content that is predominantly monetized as a group, the aggregate unamortized costs of the group are compared to the present value of the discounted cash flows using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content.",
        "If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group.",
        "If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written-off immediately.",
        "Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of assessing recoverability.81TABLE OF CONTENTSInternal-Use Software CostsThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training.",
        "Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended.",

        "At inception or modification, the Company calculates the present value of operating lease payments using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease, which is determined by estimating what it would cost the Company to borrow a collateralized amount equal to the total lease payments over the lease term based on the contractual terms of the lease and the location of the leased asset.",
        "Our leases may require us to make fixed rental payments, variable lease payments based on usage or sales and fixed non-lease costs relating to the leased asset.",
        "Variable lease payments are generally not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability.",
        "Fixed non-lease costs, for example common-area maintenance costs, are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived AssetsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
        "The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
        "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
        "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2022, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
        "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
        "We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
        "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
        "In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.",
        "We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.",
        "If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair 82TABLE OF CONTENTSvalue.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
        "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows.The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.",
        "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
        "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.",
        "The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our FCC licenses and trademarks, which are our most significant indefinite-lived intangible assets.Finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods up to 40 years.",
        "The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
        "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
        "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses.",
        "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
        "The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.2 billion, $0.3 billion, and $5.2 billion in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.The fiscal 2022 charges primarily related to our businesses in Russia.The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.The fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of MVPD agreement intangibles assets ($1.9 billion) and goodwill ($3.1 billion) at the International Channels business.",

        "The Company primarily enters into two types of derivatives: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure.",
        "Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment.",
        "Hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g.",
        "forecasted revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g.",
        "floating-rate debt).The Company designates and assigns the derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities.",
        "When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged occur or are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated derivatives.83TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company’s hedge positions are measured at fair value on the balance sheet.",
        "Realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged.",
        "The Company accrues the differential for interest rate swaps to be paid or received under the agreements as interest rates change as adjustments to interest expense over the lives of the swaps.",
        "Gains and losses on the termination of effective swap agreements, prior to their original maturity, are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying hedged transactions.The Company enters into derivatives that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting.",
        "These derivatives are intended to offset certain economic exposures of the Company and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings.",
        "Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under the same category as the cash flows from the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions (see Notes 8 and 17).Income TaxesDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded with respect to temporary differences in the accounting treatment of items for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes.",
        "Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount that, in management’s judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.A tax position must meet a minimum probability threshold before a financial statement benefit is recognized.",
        "The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.",
        "The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsThe Company consolidates the results of certain subsidiaries that are less than 100% owned and for which the noncontrolling interest shareholders have the rights to require the Company to purchase their interests in these subsidiaries.",
        "The most significant of these are Hulu LLC (Hulu) and BAMTech LLC (BAMTech).Hulu provides DTC streaming services and is owned 67% by the Company and 33% by NBC Universal (NBCU).",
        "In May 2019, the Company entered into a put/call agreement with NBCU that provided the Company with full operational control of Hulu.",
        "Under the agreement, beginning in January 2024, NBCU has the option to require the Company to purchase NBCU’s interest in Hulu and the Company has the option to require NBCU to sell its interest in Hulu to the Company, in either case at a redemption value based on NBCU’s equity ownership percentage of the greater of Hulu’s then equity fair value or a guaranteed floor value of $27.5 billion.NBCU’s interest will generally not be allocated its portion of Hulu’s losses, if any, as the redeemable noncontrolling interest is required to be carried at a minimum value.",
        "The minimum value is equal to the fair value as of the May 2019 agreement date accreted to the January 2024 estimated redemption value.",
        "At October 1, 2022, NBCU’s interest in Hulu is recorded in the Company’s financial statements at $8.7 billion.BAMTech provides streaming technology services and is owned 85% by the Company and 15% by Major League Baseball (MLB).MLB has the right to sell its interest to the Company and the Company has the right to buy MLB’s interest starting five years from and ending ten years after the Company’s September 25, 2017 acquisition date of BAMTech, in either case at a redemption value based on MLB’s equity ownership percentage of the greater of BAMTech’s then equity fair value or a guaranteed floor value ($563 million accreting at 8% annually for eight years from the date of acquisition).",
        "The MLB interest is required to be carried at a minimum value equal to its acquisition date fair value accreted to its estimated redemption value through the applicable redemption date.",
        "Therefore, the MLB interest is generally not allocated its portion of BAMTech losses, if any.",
        "As of October 1, 2022, the MLB interest was recorded in the Company’s financial statements at $828 million.",
        "In November 2022, the Company purchased MLB’s 15% interest for $900 million.Our estimate of the redemption value of noncontrolling interests requires management to make significant judgments with respect to the future value of the noncontrolling interests.",
        "We are accreting the noncontrolling interests of Hulu to its guaranteed floor value.",
        "If our estimate of the future redemption value increased above the guaranteed floor value, we would change our rate of accretion, which would generally increase the amount recorded in “Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests” and thus reduce “Net income (loss) attributable to The Walt Disney Company (Disney)” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.84TABLE OF CONTENTSEarnings Per ShareThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts.",
        "Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Disney by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.",
        "Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year, which is calculated using the treasury-stock method for equity-based awards (Awards).",
