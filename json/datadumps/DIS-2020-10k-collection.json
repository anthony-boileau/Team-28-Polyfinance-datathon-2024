    "For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsAt the beginning of fiscal 2020, the Company adopted on a prospective basis, new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance that updates the accounting for film and television content costs.",
    "Under that new guidance, we amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group.",
    "See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).With respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance.",
    "Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance.",
    "Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort.",
    "Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows, including intersegment content transactions, and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms.",
    "Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year.",
    "If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment.",
    "Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
    "The determination of projected usage requires judgement and is reviewed periodically for changes.",
    "If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue (relative value).",
    "If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.",
    "If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.Revenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business.",
    "Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions.",
    "Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually.",
    "Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date.",
    "A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate.",
    "We reduced our discount rate to 2.82% at the end of fiscal 2020 from 3.22% at the end of fiscal 2019 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2020 year-end measurement date.",
    "The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves.",
    "A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2021 by approximately $351 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 3, 2020 by approximately $4.0 billion.",
    "A one 57TABLE OF CONTENTSpercentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $303 million and $3.4 billion, respectively.To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class.",
    "Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense.",
    "A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2021 annual expense by approximately $164 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
    "Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
    "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
    "The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.",
    "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2020, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
    "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
    "We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
    "The projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property.",
    "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
    "In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
    "The qualitative assessment requires consideration of recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows.",
    "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.",
    "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
    "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
    "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
    "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
    "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets.",
    "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group.",
    "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
    "Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.58TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company has investments in equity securities.",
    "For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherit in the external markets for these investments.",
    "If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $5.2 billion and $0.6 billion in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.",
    "The fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of MVPD agreement intangibles assets ($1.9 billion) and goodwill ($3.1 billion) at the International Channels’ business as discussed below under “Impacts of COVID-19 on Accounting Policies and Estimates.”The fiscal 2019 charges primarily related to impairments of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting recorded in “Equity in the income (loss) of investees” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Allowance for Credit LossesWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business.",
    "In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods.",
    "If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.",
    "Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings.",
    "These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate.",
    "From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss.",
    "It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters.",
    "See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income TaxAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.",
    "From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments.",
    "Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities.",
    "The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.Impacts of COVID-19 on Accounting Policies and EstimatesIn light of the currently unknown ultimate duration and severity of COVID-19, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply our significant accounting policies.",
    "As COVID-19 continues to develop, we may make changes to these estimates and judgments over time, which could result in meaningful impacts to our financial statements in future periods.",
    "A more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on the Accounting Policies and Estimates follows.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsCertain of our completed or in progress film and television productions have had their initial release dates delayed or canceled.",
    "The duration of the delay, market conditions when we release the content, or a change in our release strategy (e.g.",
    "bypassing certain distribution windows) could have an impact on Ultimate Revenues, which may accelerate amortization or result in an impairment of capitalized film and television production costs.Given the ongoing uncertainty around the resumption and continuation of live sporting events, the amount and timing of revenues derived from the broadcast of these events may differ from the projections of revenues that support our amortization pattern of the rights costs we pay for these events.",
    "Such changes in revenues could result in an acceleration or slowing of the amortization of our sports rights costs.59TABLE OF CONTENTSRevenue RecognitionCertain of our affiliate contracts contain commitments with respect to the content to be aired on our television networks (e.g.",
    "live sports or original content).",
    "If there are delays or cancellations of live sporting events or disruptions to film and television content production activities, we may need to assess the impact on our contractual obligations and adjust the revenue that we recognize related to these contracts.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsGiven the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 across our businesses, the projected cash flows that we use to assess the fair value of our businesses and assets for purposes of impairment testing are subject to greater uncertainty than normal.",
    "If in the future we reduce our estimate of cash flow projections, we may need to impair some of these assets.Our International Channels reporting unit, which is part of the Direct-to-Consumer & International segment, comprises the Company’s international television networks.",
    "Our international television networks primarily derive revenues from affiliate fees charged to MVPDs for the right to deliver our programming under multi-year licensing agreements and the sales of advertising time/space on the networks.",
    "A majority of the operations in this reporting unit were acquired in the TFCF acquisition and therefore the fair value of these businesses approximated the carrying value at the date of the acquisition of TFCF.The International Channels business has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in decreased viewership and lower advertising revenue related to the availability of content, including the deferral or cancellation of certain live sporting events.",
    "The Company’s increased focus on DTC distribution in international markets is expected to negatively impact the International Channels business as we shift the primary means of monetizing our film and television content from licensing of linear channels to use on our DTC services because the International Channels reporting unit valuation does not include the value derived from this shift, which is reflected in other reporting units.",
    "In addition, the industry shift to DTC, including by us and many of our distributors, who are pursuing their own DTC strategies, has changed the competitive dynamics for the International Channels business and resulted in unfavorable affiliation renewal terms for certain of our distribution agreements.In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we assessed the International Channels’ long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and recorded impairments of $1.9 billion primarily related to MVPD agreement intangible assets and $3.1 billion related to goodwill.See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the impairment tests performed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.Risk Management ContractsThe Company employs a variety of financial instruments (derivatives) including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.Changes to our hedged cash flows from a decrease in projected revenues of the Company or reductions of projected usage of commodities as compared to our projections when we entered into hedges may cause us to recognize gains or losses on our hedging instruments in our income statement prior to when the hedged transaction was projected to occur.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” made by or on behalf of the Company.",
    "We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our shareholders.",
    "Such statements may, for example, express expectations, projections, estimates or future impacts; actions that we may take (or not take); or developments beyond our control, including changes in domestic or global economic conditions.",
    "All forward-looking statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance as of the time the statements are made and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update its disclosure relating to forward-looking matters.",
    "Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied.",
    "Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K as well as in this Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Item 1 - Business.60TABLE OF CONTENTSITEM 7A.",
    "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.Policies and ProceduresIn the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs.",
    "To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings.",
    "By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges.",

    "Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.",
    "By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years.",
    "The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures.",
    "The economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes.",

    "Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 3, 2020.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 3, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.71TABLE OF CONTENTSREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Walt Disney CompanyOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 3, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).",

    "Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.",
    "We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.",
    "federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.",
    "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
    "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.",
    "Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.",
    "We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
    "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
    "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.72TABLE OF CONTENTSCritical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
    "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Goodwill – Interim Impairment Assessment for International Channels Reporting UnitAs described in Notes 2, 4 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $77.7 billion as of October 3, 2020.",
    "Management tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
    "In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, management performed an impairment test of the International Channels’ goodwill.",
    "The carrying value of the International Channels exceeded the fair value and management recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $3.1 billion to fully impair the International Channels reporting unit goodwill.",
    "The fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The determination of fair value required management to make assumptions and estimates about how market participants would value the International Channels.",
    "The more sensitive inputs used in the discounted cash flow analysis include future revenue growth and projected margins as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill interim impairment assessment of the International Channels reporting unit is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment required of management when determining the fair value of the International Channels reporting unit, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s significant assumptions related to future revenue growth, projected margins, and the discount rates used in the fair value measurement of the International Channels reporting unit.",
    "In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
    "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill interim impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the International Channels reporting unit.",
    "These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for determining the fair value estimates, which included (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the model; and (iii) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to the future revenue growth, projected margins and discount rates.",
    "Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future revenue growth and projected margins involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.",
    "Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discount rates.Amortization of Produced Content Cost – Predominantly Monetized as a GroupAs described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company produces content for its Direct-to-Consumer (“DTC”) streaming services and linear television networks.",
    "The Company generally classifies the content that is initially intended for use on their DTC services or on their linear television networks as group assets.",
    "Production costs predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage (which may be, for example, derived from historical viewership patterns), typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
    "For the year ended October 3, 2020, the Company recognized $5.0 billion of amortization expense related to produced content cost predominantly monetized as a group, which is primarily included in “Cost of services” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of produced content costs predominantly monetized as a group is a critical audit matter are the high degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management’s estimate of projected usage used in the amortization calculation.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
    "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to amortization of produced content costs predominantly monetized as a group including controls over the estimation of projected usage.",
    "These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method and testing the completeness and accuracy of the historical viewership data used to calculate the estimate of projected usage./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPLos Angeles, CaliforniaNovember 25, 2020 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1938.73TABLE OF CONTENTSCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(in

worldwide entertainment company with operations in the following business segments: Media Networks; Parks, Experiences and Products; Studio Entertainment; and Direct-to-Consumer & International (DTCI).",
    "In October 2020, the Company announced a strategic reorganization of our media and entertainment businesses to accelerate the growth of our direct-to-consumer (DTC) strategy.",
    "The operations of the Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and DTCI segments were reorganized into four groups: three content groups (Studios, General Entertainment and Sports), which are focused on developing and producing content that will be used across all of our traditional and DTC platforms and a distribution group, which is focused on distribution and commercialization activities across these platforms and which has full accountability for media and entertainment operating results globally.The terms “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” are used in this report to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which various businesses are conducted.",
    "The term “TWDC” is used to refer to the parent company.Impact of COVID-19During fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.",
    "COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at Parks, Experiences and Products where our theme parks were closed or operating at significantly reduced capacity for a significant portion of the year, cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended since late in the second quarter and retail stores were closed for a significant portion of the year.",
    "We also had an adverse impact on our merchandise licensing business.",
    "Our Studio Entertainment segment has delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled, theatrical releases, and stage play performances have been suspended since late in the second quarter.",
    "We also had adverse impacts on advertising sales at Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer & International.",
    "Since March 2020, we have experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content, including the shift of key live sports programming from our third quarter to the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021 as well as the suspension of production of most film and television content since late in the second quarter, although some film and television production resumed in the fourth quarter.The impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.",
    "As some of our businesses have reopened, we have incurred additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, talent and guests.In fiscal 2020, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $5.0 billion, in part due to the negative impact COVID-19 has had on the International Channels business (see Note 19).Acquisition of TFCFOn March 20, 2019, the Company acquired Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., a diversified global media and entertainment company, which was subsequently renamed TFCF Corporation (TFCF).",

    "TFCF retained all of the assets and liabilities not transferred to New Fox, the most significant of which were the Twentieth Century Fox film and television studios, certain cable networks (primarily FX and National Geographic), TFCF’s international television businesses (including Star) and TFCF’s 30% interest in Hulu LLC (Hulu).",
    "Under the terms of the agreement governing the acquisition, the Company will generally phase-out Fox brands by 2024, but has perpetual rights to certain Fox brands, including Twentieth Century Fox and Fox Searchlight, although these have been rebranded to Twentieth Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures, respectively.As a result of the acquisition, the Company’s ownership in Hulu LLC (Hulu) increased from 30% to 60% (67% as of October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019).",
    "The acquired TFCF operations and Hulu have been consolidated since the acquisition.",
    "In order to obtain regulatory approval for the acquisition, the Company agreed to sell TFCF’s domestic regional sports networks (RSNs) (sold in August 2019 for approximately $11 billion) and sports media operations in Brazil and Mexico.",
    "In addition, the Company agreed to divest its interest in certain European cable channels that were controlled by A+E Television Networks (A+E) (sold in April 2019 for an amount that was not material).",

    "Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.The Company enters into relationships with or makes investments in other entities that may be variable interest entities (VIE).",

    "Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership.",
    "Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks.",

    "Actual results may differ from those estimates.86TABLE OF CONTENTSRevenues and Costs from Services and ProductsThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.",
    "Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream.",
    "The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.Significant service revenues include:•Affiliate fees•Advertising revenues•Subscription fees to our DTC streaming services•Revenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties•Admissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages•Licensing of intellectual property for use on consumer merchandise, published materials and in multi-platform gamesSignificant operating costs related to the sale of services include:•Amortization of programming and production costs and participations and residuals costs•Distribution costs•Operating labor•Facilities and infrastructure costsSignificant tangible product revenues include:•The sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our retail locations•The sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs•The sale of books, comic books and magazinesSignificant operating costs related to the sale of tangible products include:•Costs of goods sold•Amortization of programming and production costs and participations and residuals costs•Distribution costs•Operating labor•Retail occupancy costsRevenue RecognitionAt the beginning of fiscal 2019, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance that replaced the existing accounting guidance for revenue recognition with a single comprehensive five-step model (“new revenue guidance”).",
    "The core principle is to recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received.",
    "We adopted the new revenue guidance using the modified retrospective method; therefore, results for reporting periods beginning after September 30, 2018 are presented under the new revenue guidance, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting.",
    "Upon adoption, we recorded a net reduction of $116 million to opening fiscal 2019 retained earnings.The most significant changes to the Company’s revenue recognition policies resulting from the adoption of the new revenue guidance are as follows:•For television and film content licensing agreements with multiple availability windows with the same licensee, the Company now defers more revenue to future windows than under the previous accounting guidance.•For licenses of character images, brands and trademarks with minimum guaranteed license fees, the excess of the minimum guaranteed amount over actual amounts earned based on a percentage of the licensee’s underlying sales (“shortfall”) is now recognized straight-line over the remaining license period once an expected shortfall is probable.",
    "Previously, shortfalls were recognized at the end of the contract period.",
    "•For licenses that include multiple television and film titles with a minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles that earns out against the aggregate fees based on the licensee’s underlying sales, the Company now allocates the minimum guaranteed license fee to each title at contract inception and recognizes the allocated license fee as revenue when the title is made available to the customer.",
    "License fees earned by titles in excess of their allocated amount are deferred until the minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles is exceeded.",
    "Once the minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles is exceeded, license fees are recognized as earned based on the licensee’s underlying sales.",
    "Previously, 87TABLE OF CONTENTSlicense fees were recognized as earned based on the licensee’s underlying sales with any shortfalls recognized at the end of the contract period.•For renewals or extensions of license agreements for television and film content, revenues are now recognized when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension.",

    "The Company has four broad categories of service revenues: licenses of rights to use our intellectual property (“IP”), sales to guests at our Parks and Experiences businesses, sales of advertising time/space and subscriptions to DTC services.",
    "The Company’s primary product revenues include the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our parks, resorts and retail stores and the sale of film and television productions in physical formats (DVD and Blu-ray).The new revenue guidance defines two types of IP licenses: IP that has “standalone functionality,” which is called functional IP, and all other IP, which is called symbolic IP.",
    "Revenue related to the license of functional IP is generally recognized upon delivery (availability) of the IP to the customer.",
    "The substantial majority of the Company’s film and television content distribution activities at the Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and DTCI segments is considered licensing of functional IP.",
    "Revenue related to the license of symbolic IP is generally recognized over the term of the license.",
    "The Company’s primary revenue stream derived from symbolic IP is the licensing of trade names, characters and visual and literary properties at the Parks, Experiences and Products segment.More detailed information about the revenue recognition policies for our key revenues is as follows:•Affiliate fees - Fees charged to affiliates (i.e., MVPDs or television stations) for the right to deliver our television network programming on a continuous basis to their customers are recognized as the programming is provided based on contractually specified per subscriber rates and the actual number of the affiliate’s customers receiving the programming.For affiliate contracts with fixed license fees, the fees are recognized ratably over the contract term.If an affiliate contract includes a minimum guaranteed license fee, the guaranteed license fee is recognized ratably over the guaranteed period and any fees earned in excess of the guarantee are recognized as earned once the minimum guarantee has been exceeded.Affiliate agreements may also include a license to use the network programming for on demand viewing.",
    "As the fees charged under these contracts are generally based on a contractually specified per subscriber rate for the number of underlying subscribers of the affiliate, revenues are recognized as earned.•Subscription fees - Fees charged to customers/subscribers and wholesale distributors for our streaming services are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription.•Advertising - Sales of advertising time/space on our television networks, digital platforms and television stations are recognized as revenue, net of agency commissions, when commercials are aired.",
    "For contracts that contain a guaranteed number of impressions, revenues are recognized based on impressions delivered.",
    "When the guaranteed number of impressions is not met (“ratings shortfall”), revenues are not recognized for the ratings shortfall until the additional impressions are delivered.•Theme park admissions - Sales of theme park tickets are recognized when the tickets are used.",
    "Sales of annual passes are recognized ratably over the period for which the pass is available for use.•Resorts and vacations - Sales of hotel room nights and cruise vacations and rentals of vacation club properties are recognized as revenue as the services are provided to the guest.",
    "Sales of vacation club properties are recognized as revenue upon the later of when title transfers to the customer or when construction activity is deemed complete.88TABLE OF CONTENTS•Merchandise, food and beverage - Sales of merchandise, food and beverages at our theme parks and resorts, cruise ships and Disney Stores are recognized at the time of sale.",
    "Sales from our branded internet shopping sites and to wholesalers are recognized upon delivery.",
    "We estimate returns and customer incentives based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of consumer demand for our products.•TV/SVOD distribution licensing - Fixed license fees charged for the right to use our television and film productions are recognized as revenue when the content is available for use by the licensee.",
    "License fees based on the underlying sales of the licensee are recognized as revenue as earned based on the contractual royalty rate applied to the licensee sales.For TV/SVOD licenses that include multiple titles with a fixed license fee across all titles, each title is considered a separate performance obligation.",
    "The fixed license fee is allocated to each title at contract inception and the allocated license fee is recognized as revenue when the title is available for use by the licensee.When the license contains a minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles, the license fees earned by titles in excess of their allocated amount are deferred until the minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles is exceeded.",
    "Once the minimum guaranteed license fee is exceeded, revenue is recognized as earned based on the licensee’s underlying sales.TV/SVOD distribution contracts may limit the licensee’s use of a title to certain defined periods of time during the contract term.",
    "In these instances, each period of availability is generally considered a separate performance obligation.",
    "For these contracts, the fixed license fee is allocated to each period of availability at contract inception based on relative standalone selling price using management’s best estimate.",
    "Revenue is recognized at the start of each availability period when the content is made available for use by the licensee.When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, revenues are recognized when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension.•Theatrical distribution licensing - Fees charged for licensing of our films to theatrical distributors are recognized as revenue based on the contractual royalty rate applied to the distributor’s underlying sales from exhibition of the film.•Merchandise licensing - Fees charged for the use of our trade names and characters in connection with the sale of a licensee’s products are recognized as revenue as earned based on the contractual royalty rate applied to the licensee’s underlying product sales.",
    "For licenses with minimum guaranteed license fees, the excess of the minimum guaranteed amount over actual royalties earned (“shortfall”) is recognized straight-line over the remaining license period once an expected shortfall is probable.•Home entertainment - Sales of our films to retailers and distributors in physical formats (DVD and Blu-ray) are recognized as revenue on the later of the delivery date or the date that the product can be sold by retailers.",
    "We reduce home entertainment revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and sales incentives based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of consumer demand for our products.",
    "Sales of our films in electronic formats are recognized as revenue when the product is available for use by the consumer.•Taxes - Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue.•Shipping and handling - Fees collected from customers for shipping and handling are recorded as revenue and the related shipping expenses are recorded in cost of products upon delivery of the product to the consumer.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.",
    "The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on our analysis of trends in overall receivables aging, specific identification of certain receivables that are at risk of not being paid, past collection experience and current economic trends.Advertising ExpenseAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.",
    "Advertising expense for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $4.7 billion, $4.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively.",
    "The increase in advertising expense for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu, partially offset by lower advertising expense at Studio Entertainment and Parks, Experience and Products segments reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on these segments.",
    "The increase in advertising expense for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less.Cash and cash equivalents subject to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash.",

    "See Note 16 for discussion of the new guidance and the Company’s accounting policy.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived AssetsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
    "Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
    "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
    "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.The qualitative assessment requires consideration of recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2020, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
    "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
    "We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
    "The projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property as if it was licensed to an unrelated third party.",
    "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.",
    "If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
    "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows.The quantitative assessment compares the fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts.",
    "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
    "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.",
    "The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our FCC licenses and trademarks.Amortizable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods up to 40 years.",
    "The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.91TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
    "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
    "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
    "An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments.",
    "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long-lived assets and the carrying amount of the group’s long-lived assets.",
    "The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying amount of each asset is above its fair value.",
    "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
    "The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $5.2 billion, $0.6 billion, and $0.2 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.",

    "The Company primarily enters into two types of derivatives: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure.",
    "Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment.",
    "Hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g.",
    "forecasted revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g.",
    "floating rate debt).The Company designates and assigns the derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities.",
    "When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged occur or are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated derivatives.The Company’s hedge positions are measured at fair value on the balance sheet.",
    "Realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged.",
    "The Company accrues the differential for interest rate swaps to be paid or received under the agreements as interest rates change as adjustments to interest expense over the lives of the swaps.",
    "Gains and losses on the termination of effective swap agreements, prior to their original maturity, are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying hedged transactions.The Company enters into derivatives that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting.",
    "These derivatives are intended to offset certain economic exposures of the Company and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings.",
    "Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under the same category as the cash flows from the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions (see Notes 9 and 18).Income TaxesDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded with respect to temporary differences in the accounting treatment of items for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes.",
    "Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is 92TABLE OF CONTENTSmore likely than not that some amount of recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount that, in management’s judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.A tax position must meet a minimum probability threshold before a financial statement benefit is recognized.",
    "The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.",
    "The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsThe Company consolidates the results of certain subsidiaries that are less than 100% owned and for which the noncontrolling interest shareholders have rights to require the Company to purchase their interests in these subsidiaries.",
    "The most significant of these are BAMTech and Hulu.BAMTech provides streaming technology services to third parties and is owned 75% by the Company, 15% by Major League Baseball (MLB) and 10% by the National Hockey League (NHL), both of which have the right to sell their interests to the Company in the future.MLB has the right to sell its interest to the Company and the Company has the right to buy MLB’s interest starting five years from and ending ten years after the Company’s September 25, 2017 acquisition date of BAMTech at the greater of fair value or a guaranteed floor value ($563 million accreting at 8% annually for eight years from the date of acquisition).",
    "The NHL can sell its interest to the Company in fiscal 2021 for $350 million.",
    "The Company has the right to acquire the NHL interest in fiscal 2021 for $500 million.The MLB and NHL interests are required to be recorded at a minimum value equal to the greater of (i) their acquisition date fair value adjusted for their share (if any) of earnings, losses, or dividends (“adjusted value”) or (ii) an accreted value from the date of the acquisition to the applicable redemption date (“accreted value”).",
    "As the accreted value is generally always higher than the adjusted value, the MLB and NHL interests are not allocated their portion of BAMTech losses.",
    "Therefore, the MLB and NHL interests are accreted to the estimated redemption value as of the earliest redemption date.",
    "As of October 3, 2020, the guaranteed floor value for the MLB interest, accreted from the date of acquisition was $710 million.",
    "The NHL previously had a right to sell its interest to the Company in fiscal 2020 for $300 million, which expired unexercised in the fourth quarter.",

    "Subsequent to the acquisition, Hulu redeemed Warner Media LLC’s (WM) 10% interest in Hulu. The redemption was funded by the Company and Hulu’s remaining noncontrolling interest holder, NBC Universal (NBCU).",
    "This resulted in the Company’s and NBCU’s interests in Hulu increasing to 67% and 33%, respectively.On May 13, 2019, the Company entered into a put/call agreement with NBCU that provided the Company with full operational control of Hulu.",
    "Under the agreement, beginning in January 2024, NBCU has the option to require the Company to purchase NBCU’s interest in Hulu and the Company has the option to require NBCU to sell its interest in Hulu to the Company, based on NBCU’s equity ownership percentage of the greater of Hulu’s then fair value or $27.5 billion.NBCU’s interest will generally not be allocated its portion of Hulu’s losses as the redeemable noncontrolling interest is required to be carried at a minimum value.",
    "The minimum value is equal to the fair value as of the May 13, 2019 agreement date accreted to the January 2024 estimated redemption value.",
    "At October 3, 2020, NBCU’s interest in Hulu is recorded in the Company’s financial statements at $8.1 billion.Adjustments to the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interests increase or decrease income available to Company shareholders and are recorded in “Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Earnings Per ShareThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts.",

    "Therefore, reporting periods beginning after September 29, 2019 are presented under the new guidance, while prior periods continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting.",
    "The new guidance does the following:•Allows for the classification of acquired/licensed television content rights as long-term assets. Previously, we reported a portion of these rights in current assets.",
    "The Company has classified approximately $3 billion of these rights as long-term in the Q1 2020 balance sheet.",
    "Advances for live programming rights made prior to the live event continue to be reported in current assets.•Aligns the capitalization of production costs for episodic television content with the capitalization of production costs for theatrical content.",
    "Previously, theatrical content production costs could be fully capitalized while episodic television production costs were generally limited to the amount of contracted revenues.",
    "This change did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements for fiscal year 2020.•Introduces the concept of “predominant monetization strategy” to classify capitalized content costs for purposes of amortization and impairment as follows:•Individual - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are directly attributable to the specific film or television title (e.g.",
    "theatrical revenues or sales to third-party television programmers).•Group - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g.",
    "subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network).The determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at commencement of production on a consolidated basis and is based on the means by which we derive third-party revenues from use of the content.",
    "Imputed title by title intersegment license fees that may be necessary for other purposes are established as required by those purposes.For these accounting purposes, we generally classify content that is initially intended for use on our DTC services or on our linear television networks as group assets.",
    "Content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees, we generally classify as individual assets.",
    "Because the new accounting guidance is applied prospectively, the predominant monetization strategy for content released prior to the beginning of fiscal 2020 is determined based on the expected means of monetization over the remaining life of the content.",
    "Thus for example, film titles that were released theatrically and in home entertainment prior to fiscal year 2020 and are now distributed on Disney+ are generally considered group content.The classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title’s monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g.",
    "content that was initially intended for license to a third-party is instead used on an owned DTC service).Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually will continue to be amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",
    "For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include intersegment license fees, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films.",
    "For episodic television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.",
    "Participations and residuals are expensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.Production costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage (which may be, for example, derived from historical viewership patterns), typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
    "Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.Licensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our linear networks or distribution on our DTC services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate.",
    "We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement.",
    "If annual contractual 102TABLE OF CONTENTSpayments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.Acquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition.",
    "Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, except it excludes the prior seasons of episodic television programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.The costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments.",
    "For content that is predominantly monetized individually, the unamortized costs are compared to the estimated fair value.",
    "The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the cash flows directly attributable to the title.",
    "To the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.",
    "For content that is predominantly monetized as a group, the aggregate unamortized costs of the group are compared to the present value of the discounted cash flows using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content.",
    "If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group.",
    "If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written-off immediately.",
    "Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of assessing recoverability.Total capitalized produced, licensed and acquired library content by predominant monetization strategy is as follows:As of October 3, 2020Predominantly Monetized IndividuallyPredominantlyMonetizedas a GroupTotalProduced and acquired library contentTheatrical film costsReleased, less amortization$3,000 $2,601 $5,601 Completed, not released522 210 732 In-process3,322 259 3,581 In development or pre-production262 16 278 $7,106 $3,086 10,192 Television costsReleased, less amortization$2,090 $5,584 $7,674 Completed, not released33 510 543 In-process263 1,831 2,094 In development or pre-production6 87 93 $2,392 $8,012 10,404 Licensed content - Programming rights and advances6,597 Total produced, licensed and acquired library content$27,193 Current portion$2,171 Non-current portion$25,022 Amortization of produced, licensed and acquired library content is as follows:Year Ended October 3, 2020PredominantlyMonetizedIndividuallyPredominantlyMonetizedas a GroupTotalTheatrical film costs$1,711$962$2,673Television costs2,594 4,070 6,664 Total produced and acquired library content costs$4,305$5,0329,337Licensed content - Programming rights and advances11,241Total produced, licensed and acquired library content costs(1)$20,578(1)Primarily included in “Costs of services” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.103TABLE OF CONTENTSAmortization of produced, licensed and acquired library content for the year ended September 28, 2019 was $17.1 billion.Total expected amortization by fiscal year of completed (released and not released) produced, licensed and acquired library content on the balance sheet as of October 3, 2020 is as follows:Predominantly Monetized IndividuallyPredominantlyMonetizedas a GroupTotalProduced contentTheatrical film costsReleased2021$731 $460 $1,191 2022347 387 734 2023195 207 402 Completed, not released2021488 8 496 Television costsReleased2021$893 $1,476 $2,369 2022460 892 1,352 2023286 570 856 Completed, not released20214 182 186 Licensed content - Television programming rights and advances2021$— $3,882 $3,882 2022— 1,338 1,338 2023— 606 606 Approximately $2.3 billion of accrued participations and residual liabilities will be paid in fiscal 2021.",

    "The Company adopted the new guidance by applying practical expedients that permit us not to reassess our prior conclusions concerning whether:•Any of our existing arrangements contain a lease;•Our existing lease arrangements are operating or finance leases;•To capitalize indirect costs; and•Existing land easements are leases.The adoption of the new guidance resulted in the recognition of approximately $3.7 billion of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, which were measured by the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments.",
    "In accordance with the guidance, the Company elected to exclude from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability leases with a remaining term of one year (“Short-term leases”).The present value of the lease payments was calculated using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease, which is determined by estimating what it would cost the Company to borrow a collateralized amount equal to the total lease payments over the lease term based on the contractual terms of the lease and the location of the leased asset.At adoption, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet we also reclassified:•Deferred rent of approximately $0.3 billion for operating leases at the end of fiscal year 2019 from “Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities” (current portion) and “Other long-term liabilities” (non-current portion) to “Other assets” (right-of-use asset);•A deferred sale leaseback gain of approximately $0.3 billion from “Deferred revenue and other” (current portion) and “Other long-term liabilities” (non-current portion) to “Retained earnings”; and•Capitalized lease assets of approximately $0.2 billion from “Parks, resorts and other property” to “Other assets” related to finance leases.Lessee ArrangementsThe Company’s operating leases primarily consist of real estate and equipment, including office space for general and administrative purposes, production facilities, retail outlets and distribution centers for consumer products, land and content broadcast equipment.",

    "Variable lease payments are generally not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability.",
    "Fixed non-lease costs, for example common-area maintenance costs, are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components.Some of our leases include renewal and/or termination options.",

    "Our international television networks primarily derive revenues from affiliate fees charged to multi-channel video programming distributors (i.e.",
    "cable, satellite, telecommunications and digital over-the-top service providers) (MVPDs) for the right to deliver our programming under multi-year licensing agreements and the sales of advertising time/space on the networks.",
    "A majority of the operations in this reporting unit were acquired in the TFCF acquisition, and therefore the fair value of these businesses approximated the carrying value at the date of the acquisition of TFCF.The International Channels business has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in decreased viewership and lower advertising revenue related to the availability of content, including the deferral of certain live sporting events.",
    "The Company’s increased focus on DTC distribution in international markets is expected to negatively impact the International Channels business as we shift the primary means of monetizing our film and television content from licensing of linear channels to use on our DTC services because the International Channels reporting unit valuation does not include the value derived from this shift, which is reflected in other reporting units.",
    "In addition, the industry shift to DTC, including by us and many of our distributors, who are pursuing their own DTC strategies, has changed the competitive dynamics for the International Channels business and resulted in unfavorable renewal terms for certain of our distribution agreements.Due to these circumstances, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we tested the International Channels’ goodwill and long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment.The impairment test requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group.",
    "Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.",
    "If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group’s long-lived assets.We determined the appropriate asset groups for our International Channels to be the regions in which they operate.",
    "We estimated the projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of an asset group.",
    "The more significant inputs used in determining our estimate of the projected undiscounted cash flows included future revenue growth and projected margins as well as the estimate of the remaining useful life of an asset group.If the carrying value of an asset group exceeded the estimated undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value.",
    "The determination of fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates about 130TABLE OF CONTENTShow market participants would value the asset groups.",
    "The most sensitive factors affecting the fair value of an asset group are the future revenue growth and projected margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge primarily on our MVPD agreement intangible assets of $1.9 billion.",
    "As of October 3, 2020, the remaining balance of the International Channels MVPD agreement intangible assets is approximately $3.0 billion.We tested the International Channels reporting unit goodwill for impairment on an interim basis by comparing the fair value of the International Channels reporting unit to its carrying value.",
    "The fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The determination of fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates about how market participants would value the International Channels.",
    "The more sensitive inputs used in the discounted cash flow analysis include future revenue growth and projected margins as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
    "Given the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, the projected cash flows and underlying assumptions are subject to greater uncertainty than normal.In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the carrying value of the International Channels exceeded the fair value, and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $3.1 billion to fully impair the International Channels reporting unit goodwill.The $1.9 billion impairment of our MVPD relationships and $3.1 billion impairment of goodwill are recorded in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.TFCF IntegrationIn fiscal 2019, the Company implemented a restructuring and integration plan as a part of its initiative to realize cost synergies from the acquisition of TFCF.",
    "The restructuring plan is substantially complete as of the end of fiscal 2020.",
    "In connection with this plan, during fiscal 2020, the Company recorded $0.5 billion of restructuring charges, which included $0.4 billion of severance (including employee contract terminations).",
    "To date, we have recorded restructuring charges of $1.7 billion, including $1.2 billion related to severance and $0.3 billion of equity based compensation costs, primarily for TFCF awards that were accelerated to vest upon the closing of the TFCF acquisition.",
    "These charges are recorded in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.",
    "With the TFCF integration efforts nearly complete, the Company expects that total severance and other restructuring charges will remain at approximately $1.7 billion.The changes in restructuring reserves related to the TFCF integration for fiscal 2019 and 2020 are as follows:Balance at September 29, 2018$— Additions in fiscal 2019:Media Networks90 Parks, Experiences and Products11 Studio Entertainment197 Direct-to-Consumer & International426 Corporate182 Total additions in fiscal 2019906 Payments in fiscal 2019(230)Balance at September 28, 2019676 Additions in fiscal 2020:Media Networks26 Parks, Experiences and Products9 Studio Entertainment92 Direct-to-Consumer & International264 Corporate62 Total additions in fiscal 2020453 Payments in fiscal 2020(772)Balance at October 3, 2020$357 OtherIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company approved a workforce reduction plan, primarily at the Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which we expect to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021.",

    "The guidance amends the rules for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod tax allocations and calculating income taxes in interim periods.",
    "It also reduces complexity in certain areas, including the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group.",
    "The guidance is effective at the beginning of the Company’s 2022 fiscal year (with early adoption permitted).",
    "We currently do not expect the new guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements.Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial InstrumentsIn June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which modifies existing guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade and loan receivables.",
    "The new guidance requires the allowance for credit losses to be measured based on expected losses over the life of the asset rather than incurred losses.",

    "The operations of the Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and DTCI segments were reorganized into four groups: three content groups (Studios, General Entertainment and Sports), which are focused on developing and producing content that will be used across all of our traditional and DTC platforms and a distribution group, which is focused on distribution and commercialization activities across these platforms and which has full accountability for media and entertainment operating results globally.COVID-19 PandemicDuring fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by COVID-19.",
    "COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at Parks, Experiences and Products where our theme parks were closed or operating at significantly reduced capacity for a significant portion of the year, cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended since late in the second quarter and retail stores were closed for a significant portion of the year.",
    "We also had an adverse impact on our merchandise licensing business.",
    "Our Studio Entertainment segment has delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled, theatrical releases, and stage play performances have been suspended since late in the second quarter.",
    "We also had adverse impacts on advertising sales at Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer & International.",
    "Since March 2020, we have experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content, including the shift of key live sports programming from our third quarter to the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021, as well as the suspension of production of most film and television content since late in the second quarter, although some film and television production resumed in the fourth quarter.We have taken a number of mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses.",
    "We have significantly increased cash balances through the issuance of senior notes in March and May 2020, and we entered into an additional $5.0 billion credit facility in April 2020.",
    "The Company (or our Board of Directors, as applicable) did not declare a dividend with respect to fiscal 2020 operations; suspended certain capital projects; reduced certain discretionary expenditures (such as spending on marketing); reduced management compensation for several months and temporarily eliminated Board of Director retainers and committee fees.",
    "In addition, we furloughed over 120,000 of our employees (who continued to receive Company provided medical benefits), many of which have returned from furlough as certain business operations have reopened.",
    "At the end of September, the Company announced a workforce reduction plan that would primarily impact Parks, Experiences and Products.",
    "Overall, approximately 32,000 employees will be terminated in the first half of fiscal 2021.",
    "We may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; reducing, or not making, certain payments, such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans; further suspending capital spending, reducing film and television content investments; or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force.",
    "Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our businesses.35TABLE OF CONTENTSThe most significant impact of COVID-19 on fiscal 2020 operating results was an estimated detriment of approximately $6.9 billion on operating income at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment due to revenue lost as a result of the closures or reduced operating capacities.",
    "The impacts at the Media Networks, Direct-to-Consumer & International and Studio Entertainment segments were less significant.",
    "Media Networks had a modest benefit reflecting the deferral of sports programming costs to fiscal 2021, when we expect rescheduled events to occur, partially offset by lower advertising revenue.",
    "At Direct-to-Consumer & International, lower advertising revenue was partially offset by lower costs including the deferral of sports programming costs into fiscal 2021.",
    "At Studio Entertainment, lower revenues due to the deferral or cancellation of significant film releases as a result of theater closures were partially offset by lower amortization, marketing and distribution costs.",
    "In total, we estimate the net adverse impact of COVID-19 on our full year segment operating income across all of our businesses was approximately $7.4 billion, inclusive of the impact at Parks, Experiences and Products.",
    "The estimated impact is net of approximately $500 million in government credits, from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) in the U.S.",
    "and a similar program in France, both primarily at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment.",
    "The impact in fiscal 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the impact on future period results, including the impact of sports programming cost deferrals.The impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.",
    "While we cannot be certain as to the duration of the impacts of COVID-19, we currently expect COVID-19 to adversely impact our financial results at least through fiscal 2021.Some of our businesses have reopened with limited operations.",
    "We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, talent and guests.",
    "For example, as we reopened theme parks and retail stores, we incurred and will continue to incur costs for such things as additional custodial services, personal protection equipment, temperature screenings and testing, sanitizer and cleaning supplies and signage, among other items.",
    "As we resume production of film and television content, including live sporting events, we anticipate incurring similar costs and productions may take longer to complete.",
    "The timing, duration and extent of these costs will depend on the timing and scope of the resumption of our operations.",
    "We currently estimate these costs may total approximately $1 billion in fiscal 2021. Some of these costs may be capitalized and amortized over future periods.",
    "With the unknown duration of COVID-19 and yet to be determined timing of the phased reopening of certain businesses, it is not possible to precisely estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our operations in future quarters.",
    "As we reopen our businesses, we will no longer benefit from certain savings related to the closure of those businesses, such as related furloughs.",
    "The reopening or closure of our businesses is dependent on applicable government requirements, which vary by location, are subject to ongoing changes, which could result from increasing COVID-19 cases.Additionally, see Part I., Item 1A.",

    "The EPS decrease for the year was due to lower segment operating income, goodwill and intangible asset impairments at our International Channels business, the comparison to a prior-year non-cash gain in connection with the acquisition of Hulu (Hulu gain), higher amortization of intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs from the TFCF acquisition and the consolidation of Hulu and higher interest expense.",
    "These decreases were partially offset by an investment gain in the current year and the comparison to investment impairments and a charge for the extinguishment of debt recorded in the prior year.",
    "The decrease in segment operating income was due to lower results at Parks, Experiences and Products and higher losses at Direct-to-Consumer & International, partially offset by an increase at our Media Networks segment.",
    "Segment operating results for the current period include a $0.5 billion net benefit from the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu.RevenuesService revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased 2%, or $1.3 billion, to $59.3 billion, driven by lower volumes at our theme parks, resorts and cruise line, a decrease in theatrical distribution and stage play revenues, lower advertising revenue and a decrease in sales of our television and film programs to third parties.",

    "The decrease in marketing costs reflected lower spending at the theatrical distribution and theme parks and resorts businesses, partially offset by increased spend for Disney+.Depreciation and amortization costs increased 28%, or $1.2 billion, to $5.3 billion due to the amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of TFCF and consolidation of Hulu and, to a lesser extent, higher depreciation for new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts.Restructuring and Impairment ChargesRestructuring and impairment charges of $5.7 billion for fiscal 2020 were due to $4,953 million of impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets at our International Channels business and $782 million of restructuring costs.",

    "For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsAt the beginning of fiscal 2020, the Company adopted on a prospective basis, new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance that updates the accounting for film and television content costs.",
    "Under that new guidance, we amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group.",
    "See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).With respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance.",
    "Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance.",
    "Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort.",
    "Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows, including intersegment content transactions, and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms.",
    "Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year.",
    "If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment.",
    "Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
    "The determination of projected usage requires judgement and is reviewed periodically for changes.",
    "If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue (relative value).",
    "If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.",
    "If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.Revenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business.",
    "Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions.",
    "Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually.",
    "Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date.",
    "A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate.",
    "We reduced our discount rate to 2.82% at the end of fiscal 2020 from 3.22% at the end of fiscal 2019 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2020 year-end measurement date.",
    "The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves.",
    "A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2021 by approximately $351 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 3, 2020 by approximately $4.0 billion.",
    "A one 57TABLE OF CONTENTSpercentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $303 million and $3.4 billion, respectively.To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class.",
    "Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense.",
    "A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2021 annual expense by approximately $164 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
    "Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
    "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
    "The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.",
    "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2020, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
    "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
    "We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
    "The projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property.",
    "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
    "In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
    "The qualitative assessment requires consideration of recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows.",
    "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.",
    "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
    "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
    "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
    "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
    "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets.",
    "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group.",
    "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
    "Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.58TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company has investments in equity securities.",
    "For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherit in the external markets for these investments.",
    "If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $5.2 billion and $0.6 billion in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.",
    "The fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of MVPD agreement intangibles assets ($1.9 billion) and goodwill ($3.1 billion) at the International Channels’ business as discussed below under “Impacts of COVID-19 on Accounting Policies and Estimates.”The fiscal 2019 charges primarily related to impairments of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting recorded in “Equity in the income (loss) of investees” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Allowance for Credit LossesWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business.",
    "In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods.",
    "If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.",
    "Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings.",
    "These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate.",
    "From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss.",
    "It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters.",
    "See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income TaxAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.",
    "From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments.",
    "Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities.",
    "The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.Impacts of COVID-19 on Accounting Policies and EstimatesIn light of the currently unknown ultimate duration and severity of COVID-19, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply our significant accounting policies.",
    "As COVID-19 continues to develop, we may make changes to these estimates and judgments over time, which could result in meaningful impacts to our financial statements in future periods.",
    "A more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on the Accounting Policies and Estimates follows.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsCertain of our completed or in progress film and television productions have had their initial release dates delayed or canceled.",
    "The duration of the delay, market conditions when we release the content, or a change in our release strategy (e.g.",
    "bypassing certain distribution windows) could have an impact on Ultimate Revenues, which may accelerate amortization or result in an impairment of capitalized film and television production costs.Given the ongoing uncertainty around the resumption and continuation of live sporting events, the amount and timing of revenues derived from the broadcast of these events may differ from the projections of revenues that support our amortization pattern of the rights costs we pay for these events.",
    "Such changes in revenues could result in an acceleration or slowing of the amortization of our sports rights costs.59TABLE OF CONTENTSRevenue RecognitionCertain of our affiliate contracts contain commitments with respect to the content to be aired on our television networks (e.g.",
    "live sports or original content).",
    "If there are delays or cancellations of live sporting events or disruptions to film and television content production activities, we may need to assess the impact on our contractual obligations and adjust the revenue that we recognize related to these contracts.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsGiven the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 across our businesses, the projected cash flows that we use to assess the fair value of our businesses and assets for purposes of impairment testing are subject to greater uncertainty than normal.",
    "If in the future we reduce our estimate of cash flow projections, we may need to impair some of these assets.Our International Channels reporting unit, which is part of the Direct-to-Consumer & International segment, comprises the Company’s international television networks.",
    "Our international television networks primarily derive revenues from affiliate fees charged to MVPDs for the right to deliver our programming under multi-year licensing agreements and the sales of advertising time/space on the networks.",
    "A majority of the operations in this reporting unit were acquired in the TFCF acquisition and therefore the fair value of these businesses approximated the carrying value at the date of the acquisition of TFCF.The International Channels business has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in decreased viewership and lower advertising revenue related to the availability of content, including the deferral or cancellation of certain live sporting events.",
    "The Company’s increased focus on DTC distribution in international markets is expected to negatively impact the International Channels business as we shift the primary means of monetizing our film and television content from licensing of linear channels to use on our DTC services because the International Channels reporting unit valuation does not include the value derived from this shift, which is reflected in other reporting units.",
    "In addition, the industry shift to DTC, including by us and many of our distributors, who are pursuing their own DTC strategies, has changed the competitive dynamics for the International Channels business and resulted in unfavorable affiliation renewal terms for certain of our distribution agreements.In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we assessed the International Channels’ long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and recorded impairments of $1.9 billion primarily related to MVPD agreement intangible assets and $3.1 billion related to goodwill.See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the impairment tests performed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.Risk Management ContractsThe Company employs a variety of financial instruments (derivatives) including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.Changes to our hedged cash flows from a decrease in projected revenues of the Company or reductions of projected usage of commodities as compared to our projections when we entered into hedges may cause us to recognize gains or losses on our hedging instruments in our income statement prior to when the hedged transaction was projected to occur.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” made by or on behalf of the Company.",
    "We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our shareholders.",
    "Such statements may, for example, express expectations, projections, estimates or future impacts; actions that we may take (or not take); or developments beyond our control, including changes in domestic or global economic conditions.",
    "All forward-looking statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance as of the time the statements are made and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update its disclosure relating to forward-looking matters.",
    "Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied.",
    "Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K as well as in this Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Item 1 - Business.60TABLE OF CONTENTS",
    "ITEM 7A.",
    "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.Policies and ProceduresIn the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs.",
    "To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings.",
    "By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges.",
    "Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S.",
    "dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses.",
    "The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions.",
    "The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar.",
    "Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.",
    "By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years.",
    "The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures.",
    "The economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes.",
    "The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.It is the Company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above.",
    "The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.Value at Risk (VAR)The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments.",
    "The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation.",
    "The Company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique).",
    "These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end.",
    "The model includes all of the Company’s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments.",
    "Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.VAR on a combined basis increased to $323 million at October 3, 2020 from $322 million at September 28, 2019.61TABLE OF CONTENTSThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):Fiscal 2020Interest RateSensitiveFinancialInstrumentsCurrencySensitiveFinancialInstrumentsEquity SensitiveFinancialInstrumentsCommodity Sensitive Financial InstrumentsCombinedPortfolioYear end fiscal 2020 VAR$304$29$81$1$323Average VAR43937323448Highest VAR71857815742Lowest VAR2211911223Year end fiscal 2019 VAR 3172812322The VAR for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort is immaterial as of October 3, 2020 and accordingly has been excluded from the above table.",

    "Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 3, 2020.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 3, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.71TABLE OF CONTENTSREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Walt Disney CompanyOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 3, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).",
    "We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 3, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 3, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.",

    "Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.",
    "We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.",
    "federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.",
    "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
    "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.",
    "Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.",
    "We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
    "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
    "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.72TABLE OF CONTENTSCritical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
    "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Goodwill – Interim Impairment Assessment for International Channels Reporting UnitAs described in Notes 2, 4 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $77.7 billion as of October 3, 2020.",
    "Management tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
    "In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, management performed an impairment test of the International Channels’ goodwill.",
    "The carrying value of the International Channels exceeded the fair value and management recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $3.1 billion to fully impair the International Channels reporting unit goodwill.",
    "The fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The determination of fair value required management to make assumptions and estimates about how market participants would value the International Channels.",
    "The more sensitive inputs used in the discounted cash flow analysis include future revenue growth and projected margins as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill interim impairment assessment of the International Channels reporting unit is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment required of management when determining the fair value of the International Channels reporting unit, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s significant assumptions related to future revenue growth, projected margins, and the discount rates used in the fair value measurement of the International Channels reporting unit.",
    "In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
    "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill interim impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the International Channels reporting unit.",
    "These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for determining the fair value estimates, which included (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the model; and (iii) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to the future revenue growth, projected margins and discount rates.",
    "Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future revenue growth and projected margins involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.",
    "Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discount rates.Amortization of Produced Content Cost – Predominantly Monetized as a GroupAs described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company produces content for its Direct-to-Consumer (“DTC”) streaming services and linear television networks.",
    "The Company generally classifies the content that is initially intended for use on their DTC services or on their linear television networks as group assets.",
    "Production costs predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage (which may be, for example, derived from historical viewership patterns), typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
    "For the year ended October 3, 2020, the Company recognized $5.0 billion of amortization expense related to produced content cost predominantly monetized as a group, which is primarily included in “Cost of services” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of produced content costs predominantly monetized as a group is a critical audit matter are the high degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management’s estimate of projected usage used in the amortization calculation.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
    "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to amortization of produced content costs predominantly monetized as a group including controls over the estimation of projected usage.",
    "These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method and testing the completeness and accuracy of the historical viewership data used to calculate the estimate of projected usage./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPLos Angeles, CaliforniaNovember 25, 2020 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1938.73TABLE OF CONTENTSCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(in

share amounts)1Description of the Business and Segment InformationThe Walt Disney Company, together with the subsidiaries through which businesses are conducted (the Company), is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in the following business segments: Media Networks; Parks, Experiences and Products; Studio Entertainment; and Direct-to-Consumer & International (DTCI).",
    "In October 2020, the Company announced a strategic reorganization of our media and entertainment businesses to accelerate the growth of our direct-to-consumer (DTC) strategy.",
    "The operations of the Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and DTCI segments were reorganized into four groups: three content groups (Studios, General Entertainment and Sports), which are focused on developing and producing content that will be used across all of our traditional and DTC platforms and a distribution group, which is focused on distribution and commercialization activities across these platforms and which has full accountability for media and entertainment operating results globally.The terms “Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” are used in this report to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which various businesses are conducted.",
    "The term “TWDC” is used to refer to the parent company.Impact of COVID-19During fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.",
    "COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at Parks, Experiences and Products where our theme parks were closed or operating at significantly reduced capacity for a significant portion of the year, cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended since late in the second quarter and retail stores were closed for a significant portion of the year.",
    "We also had an adverse impact on our merchandise licensing business.",
    "Our Studio Entertainment segment has delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled, theatrical releases, and stage play performances have been suspended since late in the second quarter.",
    "We also had adverse impacts on advertising sales at Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer & International.",
    "Since March 2020, we have experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content, including the shift of key live sports programming from our third quarter to the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021 as well as the suspension of production of most film and television content since late in the second quarter, although some film and television production resumed in the fourth quarter.The impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.",
    "As some of our businesses have reopened, we have incurred additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, talent and guests.In fiscal 2020, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $5.0 billion, in part due to the negative impact COVID-19 has had on the International Channels business (see Note 19).Acquisition of TFCFOn March 20, 2019, the Company acquired Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., a diversified global media and entertainment company, which was subsequently renamed TFCF Corporation (TFCF).",
    "Prior to the acquisition, TFCF and a newly-formed subsidiary of TFCF (New Fox) entered into a separation agreement, pursuant to which TFCF transferred to New Fox a portfolio of TFCF’s news, sports and broadcast businesses and certain other assets.",
    "TFCF retained all of the assets and liabilities not transferred to New Fox, the most significant of which were the Twentieth Century Fox film and television studios, certain cable networks (primarily FX and National Geographic), TFCF’s international television businesses (including Star) and TFCF’s 30% interest in Hulu LLC (Hulu).",
    "Under the terms of the agreement governing the acquisition, the Company will generally phase-out Fox brands by 2024, but has perpetual rights to certain Fox brands, including Twentieth Century Fox and Fox Searchlight, although these have been rebranded to Twentieth Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures, respectively.As a result of the acquisition, the Company’s ownership in Hulu LLC (Hulu) increased from 30% to 60% (67% as of October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019).",
    "The acquired TFCF operations and Hulu have been consolidated since the acquisition.",
    "In order to obtain regulatory approval for the acquisition, the Company agreed to sell TFCF’s domestic regional sports networks (RSNs) (sold in August 2019 for approximately $11 billion) and sports media operations in Brazil and Mexico.",
    "In addition, the Company agreed to divest its interest in certain European cable channels that were controlled by A+E Television Networks (A+E) (sold in April 2019 for an amount that was not material).",
    "In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company 79TABLE OF CONTENTSreceived regulatory approval to retain the sports media operation in Brazil.",
    "The RSNs and sports media operation in Mexico, along with certain other businesses to be divested, are presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.",
    "At October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the assets and liabilities of the businesses held for sale are not material and are included in other assets and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.",
    "The sports media operation in Brazil was previously presented as discontinued operations, with its assets and liabilities considered held for sale, but is now reported as continuing operations in the current and prior periods.",

    "Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership.",

    "The core principle is to recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received.",
    "We adopted the new revenue guidance using the modified retrospective method; therefore, results for reporting periods beginning after September 30, 2018 are presented under the new revenue guidance, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting.",
    "Upon adoption, we recorded a net reduction of $116 million to opening fiscal 2019 retained earnings.The most significant changes to the Company’s revenue recognition policies resulting from the adoption of the new revenue guidance are as follows:•For television and film content licensing agreements with multiple availability windows with the same licensee, the Company now defers more revenue to future windows than under the previous accounting guidance.•For licenses of character images, brands and trademarks with minimum guaranteed license fees, the excess of the minimum guaranteed amount over actual amounts earned based on a percentage of the licensee’s underlying sales (“shortfall”) is now recognized straight-line over the remaining license period once an expected shortfall is probable.",
    "Previously, shortfalls were recognized at the end of the contract period.",
    "•For licenses that include multiple television and film titles with a minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles that earns out against the aggregate fees based on the licensee’s underlying sales, the Company now allocates the minimum guaranteed license fee to each title at contract inception and recognizes the allocated license fee as revenue when the title is made available to the customer.",
    "License fees earned by titles in excess of their allocated amount are deferred until the minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles is exceeded.",
    "Once the minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles is exceeded, license fees are recognized as earned based on the licensee’s underlying sales.",
    "Previously, 87TABLE OF CONTENTSlicense fees were recognized as earned based on the licensee’s underlying sales with any shortfalls recognized at the end of the contract period.•For renewals or extensions of license agreements for television and film content, revenues are now recognized when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension.",
    "Previously, revenues were recognized when the agreement was renewed or extended.The impact on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2019 due to the adoption of the new revenue guidance was as follows:Results AssumingHistorical AccountingImpact of New Revenue GuidanceReportedRevenues$69,262 $345 $69,607 Cost and Expenses(57,523) (254) (57,777) Income Taxes(3,005) (21) (3,026) Net Income11,514 70 11,584 The most significant impact was at the Studio Entertainment reflecting a change in the timing of revenue recognition related to film content licensing agreements with multiple availability windows.The Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and products.",

    "The Company’s primary product revenues include the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our parks, resorts and retail stores and the sale of film and television productions in physical formats (DVD and Blu-ray).The new revenue guidance defines two types of IP licenses: IP that has “standalone functionality,” which is called functional IP, and all other IP, which is called symbolic IP.",
    "Revenue related to the license of functional IP is generally recognized upon delivery (availability) of the IP to the customer.",
    "The substantial majority of the Company’s film and television content distribution activities at the Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and DTCI segments is considered licensing of functional IP.",
    "Revenue related to the license of symbolic IP is generally recognized over the term of the license.",
    "The Company’s primary revenue stream derived from symbolic IP is the licensing of trade names, characters and visual and literary properties at the Parks, Experiences and Products segment.More detailed information about the revenue recognition policies for our key revenues is as follows:•Affiliate fees - Fees charged to affiliates (i.e., MVPDs or television stations) for the right to deliver our television network programming on a continuous basis to their customers are recognized as the programming is provided based on contractually specified per subscriber rates and the actual number of the affiliate’s customers receiving the programming.For affiliate contracts with fixed license fees, the fees are recognized ratably over the contract term.If an affiliate contract includes a minimum guaranteed license fee, the guaranteed license fee is recognized ratably over the guaranteed period and any fees earned in excess of the guarantee are recognized as earned once the minimum guarantee has been exceeded.Affiliate agreements may also include a license to use the network programming for on demand viewing.",
    "As the fees charged under these contracts are generally based on a contractually specified per subscriber rate for the number of underlying subscribers of the affiliate, revenues are recognized as earned.•Subscription fees - Fees charged to customers/subscribers and wholesale distributors for our streaming services are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription.•Advertising - Sales of advertising time/space on our television networks, digital platforms and television stations are recognized as revenue, net of agency commissions, when commercials are aired.",
    "For contracts that contain a guaranteed number of impressions, revenues are recognized based on impressions delivered.",
    "When the guaranteed number of impressions is not met (“ratings shortfall”), revenues are not recognized for the ratings shortfall until the additional impressions are delivered.•Theme park admissions - Sales of theme park tickets are recognized when the tickets are used.",
    "Sales of annual passes are recognized ratably over the period for which the pass is available for use.•Resorts and vacations - Sales of hotel room nights and cruise vacations and rentals of vacation club properties are recognized as revenue as the services are provided to the guest.",
    "Sales of vacation club properties are recognized as revenue upon the later of when title transfers to the customer or when construction activity is deemed complete.88TABLE OF CONTENTS•Merchandise, food and beverage - Sales of merchandise, food and beverages at our theme parks and resorts, cruise ships and Disney Stores are recognized at the time of sale.",
    "Sales from our branded internet shopping sites and to wholesalers are recognized upon delivery.",
    "We estimate returns and customer incentives based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of consumer demand for our products.•TV/SVOD distribution licensing - Fixed license fees charged for the right to use our television and film productions are recognized as revenue when the content is available for use by the licensee.",
    "License fees based on the underlying sales of the licensee are recognized as revenue as earned based on the contractual royalty rate applied to the licensee sales.For TV/SVOD licenses that include multiple titles with a fixed license fee across all titles, each title is considered a separate performance obligation.",
    "The fixed license fee is allocated to each title at contract inception and the allocated license fee is recognized as revenue when the title is available for use by the licensee.When the license contains a minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles, the license fees earned by titles in excess of their allocated amount are deferred until the minimum guaranteed license fee across all titles is exceeded.",
    "Once the minimum guaranteed license fee is exceeded, revenue is recognized as earned based on the licensee’s underlying sales.TV/SVOD distribution contracts may limit the licensee’s use of a title to certain defined periods of time during the contract term.",
    "In these instances, each period of availability is generally considered a separate performance obligation.",
    "For these contracts, the fixed license fee is allocated to each period of availability at contract inception based on relative standalone selling price using management’s best estimate.",
    "Revenue is recognized at the start of each availability period when the content is made available for use by the licensee.When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, revenues are recognized when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension.•Theatrical distribution licensing - Fees charged for licensing of our films to theatrical distributors are recognized as revenue based on the contractual royalty rate applied to the distributor’s underlying sales from exhibition of the film.•Merchandise licensing - Fees charged for the use of our trade names and characters in connection with the sale of a licensee’s products are recognized as revenue as earned based on the contractual royalty rate applied to the licensee’s underlying product sales.",
    "For licenses with minimum guaranteed license fees, the excess of the minimum guaranteed amount over actual royalties earned (“shortfall”) is recognized straight-line over the remaining license period once an expected shortfall is probable.•Home entertainment - Sales of our films to retailers and distributors in physical formats (DVD and Blu-ray) are recognized as revenue on the later of the delivery date or the date that the product can be sold by retailers.",
    "We reduce home entertainment revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and sales incentives based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of consumer demand for our products.",
    "Sales of our films in electronic formats are recognized as revenue when the product is available for use by the consumer.•Taxes - Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue.•Shipping and handling - Fees collected from customers for shipping and handling are recorded as revenue and the related shipping expenses are recorded in cost of products upon delivery of the product to the consumer.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.",
    "The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on our analysis of trends in overall receivables aging, specific identification of certain receivables that are at risk of not being paid, past collection experience and current economic trends.Advertising ExpenseAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.",
    "Advertising expense for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $4.7 billion, $4.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively.",
    "The increase in advertising expense for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu, partially offset by lower advertising expense at Studio Entertainment and Parks, Experience and Products segments reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on these segments.",
    "The increase in advertising expense for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less.Cash and cash equivalents subject to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash.",
    "The Company’s restricted cash balances are primarily made up of cash posted as collateral for certain derivative instruments.89TABLE OF CONTENTSThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to the total of the amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.October 3, 2020September 28, 2019September 29, 2018Cash and cash equivalents$17,914$5,418$4,150Restricted cash included in:Other current assets3261Other assets37114Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows$17,954$5,455$4,155InvestmentsInvestments in equity securities with a readily determinable fair value, not accounted for under the equity method, are recorded at that value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.",
    "For equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, the investment is recorded at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus adjustments related to observable transactions for the same or similar securities, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.For equity method investments, the Company regularly reviews its investments to determine whether there is a decline in fair value below book value.",
    "If there is a decline that is other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to fair value.Translation PolicyGenerally, the U.S.",
    "dollar is the functional currency for our international film and television distribution and licensing businesses and the branded International Channels.",
    "Generally, the local currency is the functional currency for the Asia Theme Parks, Disneyland Paris, the branded International Channels that primarily source and exploit their content locally (primarily Star branded channels in India and international sports channels) and international locations of The Disney Stores.For U.S.",
    "dollar functional currency locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for non-monetary balance sheet accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates.",
    "Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates.",
    "Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income.For local currency functional locations, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period.",
    "Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI).InventoriesInventory primarily includes vacation timeshare units, merchandise, food, materials and supplies.",
    "Carrying amounts of vacation ownership units are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value.",
    "Carrying amounts of merchandise, food, materials and supplies inventories are generally determined on a moving average cost basis and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value.Film and Television Content CostsAt the beginning of fiscal 2020, the Company adopted new FASB guidance that updates the accounting for film and television content costs.",
    "See Note 8 for discussion of the new guidance and the Company’s accounting policy for capitalization and amortization of film and television content costs.Internal-Use Software CostsThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training.",
    "Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended.",
    "As of October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled $778 million and $927 million, respectively.",
    "The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software up to 10 years.90TABLE OF CONTENTSParks, Resorts and Other PropertyParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost.",
    "Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over estimated useful lives as follows:Attractions, buildings and improvements20 – 40 yearsFurniture, fixtures and equipment3 – 25 yearsLand improvements20 – 40 yearsLeasehold improvementsLife of lease or asset life if lessLeasesAt the beginning of fiscal 2020, the Company adopted new FASB guidance that requires lessees to record the present value of operating lease payments as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.",
    "See Note 16 for discussion of the new guidance and the Company’s accounting policy.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived AssetsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
    "Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
    "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
    "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.The qualitative assessment requires consideration of recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2020, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
    "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
    "We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
    "The projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property as if it was licensed to an unrelated third party.",
    "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.",
    "If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
    "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows.The quantitative assessment compares the fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts.",
    "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
    "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.",
    "The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our FCC licenses and trademarks.Amortizable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods up to 40 years.",
    "The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.91TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
    "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
    "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
    "An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments.",
    "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long-lived assets and the carrying amount of the group’s long-lived assets.",
    "The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying amount of each asset is above its fair value.",
    "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
    "The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $5.2 billion, $0.6 billion, and $0.2 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.",
    "The fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of MVPD agreement intangibles assets ($1.9 billion) and goodwill ($3.1 billion) at the International Channels’ business.",
    "See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on these impairment charges.",
    "The fiscal 2019 and 2018 charges primarily related to impairments of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting recorded in “Equity in the income (loss) of investees” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Company expects its aggregate annual amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets for fiscal 2021 through 2025 to be as follows:2021$2,05520221,99520231,80820241,57020251,471Risk Management ContractsIn the normal course of business, the Company employs a variety of financial instruments (derivatives) including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.The Company formally documents all relationships between hedges and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions.",
    "The Company primarily enters into two types of derivatives: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure.",
    "Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment.",
    "Hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g.",
    "forecasted revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g.",
    "floating rate debt).The Company designates and assigns the derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities.",
    "When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged occur or are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated derivatives.The Company’s hedge positions are measured at fair value on the balance sheet.",
    "Realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged.",
    "The Company accrues the differential for interest rate swaps to be paid or received under the agreements as interest rates change as adjustments to interest expense over the lives of the swaps.",
    "Gains and losses on the termination of effective swap agreements, prior to their original maturity, are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying hedged transactions.The Company enters into derivatives that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting.",
    "These derivatives are intended to offset certain economic exposures of the Company and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings.",
    "Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under the same category as the cash flows from the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions (see Notes 9 and 18).Income TaxesDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded with respect to temporary differences in the accounting treatment of items for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes.",
    "Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is 92TABLE OF CONTENTSmore likely than not that some amount of recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount that, in management’s judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.A tax position must meet a minimum probability threshold before a financial statement benefit is recognized.",
    "The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.",
    "The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsThe Company consolidates the results of certain subsidiaries that are less than 100% owned and for which the noncontrolling interest shareholders have rights to require the Company to purchase their interests in these subsidiaries.",
    "The most significant of these are BAMTech and Hulu.BAMTech provides streaming technology services to third parties and is owned 75% by the Company, 15% by Major League Baseball (MLB) and 10% by the National Hockey League (NHL), both of which have the right to sell their interests to the Company in the future.MLB has the right to sell its interest to the Company and the Company has the right to buy MLB’s interest starting five years from and ending ten years after the Company’s September 25, 2017 acquisition date of BAMTech at the greater of fair value or a guaranteed floor value ($563 million accreting at 8% annually for eight years from the date of acquisition).",
    "The NHL can sell its interest to the Company in fiscal 2021 for $350 million.",
    "The Company has the right to acquire the NHL interest in fiscal 2021 for $500 million.The MLB and NHL interests are required to be recorded at a minimum value equal to the greater of (i) their acquisition date fair value adjusted for their share (if any) of earnings, losses, or dividends (“adjusted value”) or (ii) an accreted value from the date of the acquisition to the applicable redemption date (“accreted value”).",
    "As the accreted value is generally always higher than the adjusted value, the MLB and NHL interests are not allocated their portion of BAMTech losses.",
    "Therefore, the MLB and NHL interests are accreted to the estimated redemption value as of the earliest redemption date.",
    "As of October 3, 2020, the guaranteed floor value for the MLB interest, accreted from the date of acquisition was $710 million.",
    "The NHL previously had a right to sell its interest to the Company in fiscal 2020 for $300 million, which expired unexercised in the fourth quarter.",
    "As the NHL’s remaining right to sell its interest to the Company in fiscal 2021 is for $350 million, the Company began accreting the NHL interest to $350 million.",
    "As of October 3, 2020, the accreted value of the NHL interest was $313 million.As part of the TFCF acquisition, the Company acquired TFCF’s 30% interest in Hulu increasing our ownership in Hulu to 60%.",
    "Subsequent to the acquisition, Hulu redeemed Warner Media LLC’s (WM) 10% interest in Hulu. The redemption was funded by the Company and Hulu’s remaining noncontrolling interest holder, NBC Universal (NBCU).",
    "This resulted in the Company’s and NBCU’s interests in Hulu increasing to 67% and 33%, respectively.On May 13, 2019, the Company entered into a put/call agreement with NBCU that provided the Company with full operational control of Hulu.",
    "Under the agreement, beginning in January 2024, NBCU has the option to require the Company to purchase NBCU’s interest in Hulu and the Company has the option to require NBCU to sell its interest in Hulu to the Company, based on NBCU’s equity ownership percentage of the greater of Hulu’s then fair value or $27.5 billion.NBCU’s interest will generally not be allocated its portion of Hulu’s losses as the redeemable noncontrolling interest is required to be carried at a minimum value.",
    "The minimum value is equal to the fair value as of the May 13, 2019 agreement date accreted to the January 2024 estimated redemption value.",
    "At October 3, 2020, NBCU’s interest in Hulu is recorded in the Company’s financial statements at $8.1 billion.Adjustments to the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interests increase or decrease income available to Company shareholders and are recorded in “Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Earnings Per ShareThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts.",
    "Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Disney by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.",
    "Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year, which is calculated using the treasury-stock method for equity-based awards (Awards).",
    "Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods for which they have an anti-dilutive effect.",
    "Stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period are anti-dilutive and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.93TABLE OF CONTENTSA reconciliation of the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding and the number of Awards excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, as they were anti-dilutive, are as follows:202020192018Weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding (basic)1,8081,6561,499Weighted average dilutive impact of Awards(1)—108Weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding (diluted)1,8081,6661,507Awards excluded from diluted earnings per share35712(1)Amounts exclude all potential common and common equivalent shares for periods when there is a net loss from continuing operations.3RevenuesThe following table presents our revenues by segment and major source: 2020MediaNetworksParks, Experiences and ProductsStudioEntertainmentDirect-to-Consumer & InternationalEliminationsConsolidatedAffiliate fees$15,018$—$—$3,673$(762)$17,929Advertising6,3744—4,477—10,855Subscription fees———7,645—7,645Theme park admissions—4,038———4,038Resort and vacations—3,402———3,402Retail and wholesale sales of merchandise, food and beverage—4,952———4,952TV/SVOD distribution licensing6,489—4,557745(5,348)6,443Theatrical distribution licensing——2,134——2,134Merchandise licensing—2,67453632—3,242Home entertainment——1,52884—1,612Other5121,432881311—3,136Total revenues$28,393$16,502$9,636$16,967$(6,110)$65,3882019MediaNetworksParks, Experiences and ProductsStudioEntertainmentDirect-to-Consumer & InternationalEliminationsConsolidatedAffiliate fees$13,433$—$—$2,768$(253)$15,948Advertising6,9656—3,542—10,513Subscription fees———2,115—2,115Theme park admissions—7,540———7,540Resort and vacations—6,266———6,266Retail and wholesale sales of merchandise, food and beverage—7,716———7,716TV/SVOD distribution licensing4,046—2,920482(1,705)5,743Theatrical distribution licensing——4,726——4,726Merchandise licensing—2,76856151—3,380Home entertainment——1,73497—1,831Other3831,9291,186331—3,829Total revenues$24,827$26,225$11,127$9,386$(1,958)$69,60794TABLE OF CONTENTS2018MediaNetworksParks, Experiences and ProductsStudioEntertainmentDirect-to-Consumer & InternationalEliminationsConsolidatedAffiliate fees$11,907$—$—$1,372$—$13,279Advertising6,5867—1,311—7,904Subscription fees———168—168Theme park admissions—7,183———7,183Resort and vacations—5,938———5,938Retail and wholesale sales of merchandise, food and beverage—7,365———7,365TV/SVOD distribution licensing3,120—2,340105(668)4,897Theatrical distribution licensing——4,303——4,303Merchandise licensing—2,56655670—3,192Home entertainment——1,647103—1,750Other3091,6421,219285—3,455Total revenues$21,922$24,701$10,065$3,414$(668)$59,434Amounts for fiscal 2018 reflect our historical accounting prior to the adoption of new revenue guidance.The following table presents our revenues by segment and primary geographical markets:2020MediaNetworksParks, Experiences and ProductsStudioEntertainmentDirect-to-Consumer & InternationalEliminationsConsolidatedAmericas$26,566$12,524$5,671$12,498$(5,267)$51,992Europe1,3781,9822,6092,016(652)7,333Asia Pacific4491,9961,3562,453(191)6,063Total revenues$28,393$16,502$9,636$16,967$(6,110)$65,3882019MediaNetworksParks, Experiences and ProductsStudioEntertainmentDirect-to-Consumer & InternationalEliminationsConsolidatedAmericas$23,767$19,868$6,050$5,759$(1,639)$53,805Europe7853,1352,9561,260(130)8,006Asia Pacific2753,2222,1212,367(189)7,796Total revenues$24,827$26,225$11,127$9,386$(1,958)$69,607Revenues recognized in the current and prior year from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous reporting periods primarily relate to revenues earned on TV/SVOD and theatrical distribution licensee sales on titles made available to the licensee in previous reporting periods.",

    "For fiscal 2019, $1.2 billion was recognized related to performance obligations satisfied prior to September 30, 2018.As of October 3, 2020, revenue for unsatisfied performance obligations expected to be recognized in the future is $16 billion, which primarily relates to content to be delivered in the future under existing agreements with television station affiliates and TV/SVOD licensees.",
    "Of this amount, we expect to recognize approximately $7 billion in fiscal 2021, $4 billion in fiscal 2022, $2 billion in fiscal 2023 and $3 billion thereafter.",
    "These amounts include only fixed consideration or minimum guarantees and do not include amounts related to (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less (such as most advertising contracts) or (ii) licenses of IP that are solely based on the sales of the licensee.Payment terms vary by the type and location of our customers and the products or services offered.",
    "For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are provided to the customer; in other cases, after appropriate credit evaluations, payment is due in arrears.",
    "Advertising contracts, which are generally short term, are billed monthly with payments generally due within 30 days.",
    "Payments due under affiliate arrangements are calculated monthly and are generally due within 30 days of month end.",
    "Home entertainment terms generally require payment within 60 to 90 days of availability date to the customer.",
    "Licensing payment terms vary by contract but are generally collected in advance or over the license term.",

    "Additionally, compensation expense of $219 million related to awards that were replaced with new restricted stock units is being recognized over the post-acquisition service period of up to approximately two years.As part of the TFCF acquisition, the Company acquired TFCF’s 30% interest in Hulu increasing our ownership in Hulu to 60%.",
    "As a result, the Company began consolidating Hulu and recorded a one-time gain of $4.8 billion (Hulu Gain) from remeasuring our initial 30% interest to its estimated fair value, which was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis.",
    "On April 15, 2019, Hulu redeemed WM’s 10% interest in Hulu for $1.4 billion. The redemption was funded by the Company and NBCU.",
    "This resulted in the Company’s and NBCU’s interests in Hulu increasing to 67% and 33%, respectively.NBCU’s interest is classified as a redeemable noncontrolling interest on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.",
    "See Note 2 for further discussion of NBCU’s interest.Upon closing of the TFCF acquisition, the Company exchanged new Disney notes for outstanding notes issued by 21st Century Fox America, Inc.",
    "with a principal balance of $16.8 billion (see Note 9).The Company is required to allocate the TFCF purchase price to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values.",
    "The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill.In determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company primarily used discounted cash flow analyses.",
    "Inputs to the discounted cash flow analyses and other aspects of the allocation of purchase price require judgment.",

    "Therefore, reporting periods beginning after September 29, 2019 are presented under the new guidance, while prior periods continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting.",
    "The new guidance does the following:•Allows for the classification of acquired/licensed television content rights as long-term assets. Previously, we reported a portion of these rights in current assets.",
    "The Company has classified approximately $3 billion of these rights as long-term in the Q1 2020 balance sheet.",
    "Advances for live programming rights made prior to the live event continue to be reported in current assets.•Aligns the capitalization of production costs for episodic television content with the capitalization of production costs for theatrical content.",
    "Previously, theatrical content production costs could be fully capitalized while episodic television production costs were generally limited to the amount of contracted revenues.",
    "This change did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements for fiscal year 2020.•Introduces the concept of “predominant monetization strategy” to classify capitalized content costs for purposes of amortization and impairment as follows:•Individual - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are directly attributable to the specific film or television title (e.g.",
    "theatrical revenues or sales to third-party television programmers).•Group - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g.",
    "subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network).The determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at commencement of production on a consolidated basis and is based on the means by which we derive third-party revenues from use of the content.",
    "Imputed title by title intersegment license fees that may be necessary for other purposes are established as required by those purposes.For these accounting purposes, we generally classify content that is initially intended for use on our DTC services or on our linear television networks as group assets.",
    "Content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees, we generally classify as individual assets.",
    "Because the new accounting guidance is applied prospectively, the predominant monetization strategy for content released prior to the beginning of fiscal 2020 is determined based on the expected means of monetization over the remaining life of the content.",
    "Thus for example, film titles that were released theatrically and in home entertainment prior to fiscal year 2020 and are now distributed on Disney+ are generally considered group content.The classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title’s monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g.",
    "content that was initially intended for license to a third-party is instead used on an owned DTC service).Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually will continue to be amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",
    "For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include intersegment license fees, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films.",
    "For episodic television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.",
    "Participations and residuals are expensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.Production costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage (which may be, for example, derived from historical viewership patterns), typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
    "Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.Licensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our linear networks or distribution on our DTC services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate.",
    "We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement.",
    "If annual contractual 102TABLE OF CONTENTSpayments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.Acquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition.",
    "Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, except it excludes the prior seasons of episodic television programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.The costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments.",
    "For content that is predominantly monetized individually, the unamortized costs are compared to the estimated fair value.",
    "The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the cash flows directly attributable to the title.",
    "To the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.",
    "For content that is predominantly monetized as a group, the aggregate unamortized costs of the group are compared to the present value of the discounted cash flows using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content.",
    "If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group.",
    "If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written-off immediately.",
    "Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of assessing recoverability.Total capitalized produced, licensed and acquired library content by predominant monetization strategy is as follows:As of October 3, 2020Predominantly Monetized IndividuallyPredominantlyMonetizedas a GroupTotalProduced and acquired library contentTheatrical film costsReleased, less amortization$3,000 $2,601 $5,601 Completed, not released522 210 732 In-process3,322 259 3,581 In development or pre-production262 16 278 $7,106 $3,086 10,192 Television costsReleased, less amortization$2,090 $5,584 $7,674 Completed, not released33 510 543 In-process263 1,831 2,094 In development or pre-production6 87 93 $2,392 $8,012 10,404 Licensed content - Programming rights and advances6,597 Total produced, licensed and acquired library content$27,193 Current portion$2,171 Non-current portion$25,022 Amortization of produced, licensed and acquired library content is as follows:Year Ended October 3, 2020PredominantlyMonetizedIndividuallyPredominantlyMonetizedas a GroupTotalTheatrical film costs$1,711$962$2,673Television costs2,594 4,070 6,664 Total produced and acquired library content costs$4,305$5,0329,337Licensed content - Programming rights and advances11,241Total produced, licensed and acquired library content costs(1)$20,578(1)Primarily included in “Costs of services” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.103TABLE OF CONTENTSAmortization of produced, licensed and acquired library content for the year ended September 28, 2019 was $17.1 billion.Total expected amortization by fiscal year of completed (released and not released) produced, licensed and acquired library content on the balance sheet as of October 3, 2020 is as follows:Predominantly Monetized IndividuallyPredominantlyMonetizedas a GroupTotalProduced contentTheatrical film costsReleased2021$731 $460 $1,191 2022347 387 734 2023195 207 402 Completed, not released2021488 8 496 Television costsReleased2021$893 $1,476 $2,369 2022460 892 1,352 2023286 570 856 Completed, not released20214 182 186 Licensed content - Television programming rights and advances2021$— $3,882 $3,882 2022— 1,338 1,338 2023— 606 606 Approximately $2.3 billion of accrued participations and residual liabilities will be paid in fiscal 2021.",

    "The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves.",
    "The Company measures service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows.Long-term rate of return on plan assets — The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments.",
    "When determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which the Company expects the pension funds to be invested.",
    "The following long-term rates of return by asset class were considered in setting the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption:Equity Securities6 %to10 %Debt Securities2 %to4 %Alternative Investments6 %to11 %Healthcare cost trend rate — The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement medical benefit plans.",

    "At the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, options can occasionally extend up to 15 years after date of grant.",

    "Equity-based award grants 118TABLE OF CONTENTSgenerally provide continued vesting, in the event of termination, for employees that reach age 60 or greater, have at least ten years of service and have held the award for at least one year.Each share granted subject to a stock option award reduces the number of shares available under the Company’s stock incentive plans by one share while each share granted subject to a RSU award reduces the number of shares available by two shares.",
    "As of October 3, 2020, the maximum number of shares available for issuance under the Company’s stock incentive plans (assuming all the awards are in the form of stock options) was approximately 160 million shares and the number available for issuance assuming all awards are in the form of RSUs was approximately 77 million shares.",

    "The fair value of options is estimated based on the binomial valuation model. The binomial valuation model takes into account variables such as volatility, dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate.",
    "The binomial valuation model also considers the expected exercise multiple (the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average) and the termination rate (the probability of a vested option being canceled due to the termination of the option holder) in computing the value of the option.The weighted average assumptions used in the option-valuation model were as follows:202020192018Risk-free interest rate1.8%2.8%2.4%Expected volatility23%23%23%Dividend yield1.36%1.61%1.57%Termination rate5.8%4.8%4.8%Exercise multiple1.83 1.75 1.75 Although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date, changes in the Company’s assumptions may change the value of, and therefore the expense related to, future stock option grants.",
    "The assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the expected volatility and expected exercise multiple.",
    "Increases or decreases in either the expected volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease, respectively.",
    "The volatility assumption considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the Company’s performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions.Compensation expense for RSUs and stock options is recognized ratably over the service period of the award.",
    "Compensation expense for RSUs is based on the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the grant date.",

    "In accordance with the guidance, the Company elected to exclude from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability leases with a remaining term of one year (“Short-term leases”).The present value of the lease payments was calculated using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease, which is determined by estimating what it would cost the Company to borrow a collateralized amount equal to the total lease payments over the lease term based on the contractual terms of the lease and the location of the leased asset.At adoption, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet we also reclassified:•Deferred rent of approximately $0.3 billion for operating leases at the end of fiscal year 2019 from “Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities” (current portion) and “Other long-term liabilities” (non-current portion) to “Other assets” (right-of-use asset);•A deferred sale leaseback gain of approximately $0.3 billion from “Deferred revenue and other” (current portion) and “Other long-term liabilities” (non-current portion) to “Retained earnings”; and•Capitalized lease assets of approximately $0.2 billion from “Parks, resorts and other property” to “Other assets” related to finance leases.Lessee ArrangementsThe Company’s operating leases primarily consist of real estate and equipment, including office space for general and administrative purposes, production facilities, retail outlets and distribution centers for consumer products, land and content broadcast equipment.",

    "Variable lease payments are generally not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability.",
    "Fixed non-lease costs, for example common-area maintenance costs, are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components.Some of our leases include renewal and/or termination options.",

    "The Company’s increased focus on DTC distribution in international markets is expected to negatively impact the International Channels business as we shift the primary means of monetizing our film and television content from licensing of linear channels to use on our DTC services because the International Channels reporting unit valuation does not include the value derived from this shift, which is reflected in other reporting units.",
    "In addition, the industry shift to DTC, including by us and many of our distributors, who are pursuing their own DTC strategies, has changed the competitive dynamics for the International Channels business and resulted in unfavorable renewal terms for certain of our distribution agreements.Due to these circumstances, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we tested the International Channels’ goodwill and long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment.The impairment test requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group.",
    "Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.",
    "If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group’s long-lived assets.We determined the appropriate asset groups for our International Channels to be the regions in which they operate.",
    "We estimated the projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of an asset group.",
    "The more significant inputs used in determining our estimate of the projected undiscounted cash flows included future revenue growth and projected margins as well as the estimate of the remaining useful life of an asset group.If the carrying value of an asset group exceeded the estimated undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value.",
    "The determination of fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates about 130TABLE OF CONTENTShow market participants would value the asset groups.",
    "The most sensitive factors affecting the fair value of an asset group are the future revenue growth and projected margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge primarily on our MVPD agreement intangible assets of $1.9 billion.",
    "As of October 3, 2020, the remaining balance of the International Channels MVPD agreement intangible assets is approximately $3.0 billion.We tested the International Channels reporting unit goodwill for impairment on an interim basis by comparing the fair value of the International Channels reporting unit to its carrying value.",
    "The fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The determination of fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates about how market participants would value the International Channels.",
    "The more sensitive inputs used in the discounted cash flow analysis include future revenue growth and projected margins as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
    "Given the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, the projected cash flows and underlying assumptions are subject to greater uncertainty than normal.In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the carrying value of the International Channels exceeded the fair value, and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $3.1 billion to fully impair the International Channels reporting unit goodwill.The $1.9 billion impairment of our MVPD relationships and $3.1 billion impairment of goodwill are recorded in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.TFCF IntegrationIn fiscal 2019, the Company implemented a restructuring and integration plan as a part of its initiative to realize cost synergies from the acquisition of TFCF.",
