        "For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group.",
        "See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).With respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance.",
        "Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance.",
        "Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort.",
        "Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms.",
        "Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year.",
        "If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment.",
        "Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
        "The determination of projected usage requires judgement and is reviewed periodically for changes.",
        "If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue (relative value).",
        "If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.",
        "If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.50TABLE OF CONTENTSRevenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business.",
        "Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions.",
        "Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually.",
        "Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date.",
        "A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate.",
        "We increased our discount rate to 2.88% at the end of fiscal 2021 from 2.82% at the end of fiscal 2020 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2021 year-end measurement date.",
        "The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves.",
        "A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2022 by approximately $341 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 2, 2021 by approximately $4.0 billion.",
        "A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $292 million and $3.4 billion, respectively.To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class.",
        "Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense.",
        "A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2022 annual expense by approximately $175 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
        "The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
        "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
        "The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.",
        "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2021, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
        "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
        "We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
        "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
        "In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.",
        "We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.",
        "If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
        "51TABLE OF CONTENTSThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows.",
        "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.",
        "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
        "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
        "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
        "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses.",
        "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
        "Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.The Company has investments in equity securities.",
        "For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments.",
        "If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.3 billion and $5.2 billion in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.",
        "The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.The fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of MVPD agreement intangible assets ($1.9 billion) and goodwill ($3.1 billion) at the International Channels’ business.",
        "See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these impairment charges.Allowance for Credit LossesWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.",
        "In times of economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods.",
        "If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.",
        "See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings.",
        "These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate.",
        "From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss.",
        "It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters.",
        "See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income TaxAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.",
        "From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments.",
        "Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities.",
        "The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to 52TABLE OF CONTENTSsettle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.Impacts of COVID-19 on Accounting Policies and EstimatesIn light of the currently unknown ultimate duration and severity of COVID-19, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply our significant accounting policies and make changes to these estimates and judgements over time.",
        "This could result in meaningful impacts to our financial statements in future periods.",
        "A more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on the Accounting Policies and Estimates follows.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsCertain of our completed or in progress film and television productions have had their initial release dates delayed.",
        "The duration of the delay, market conditions when we release the content, or a change in our release strategy (e.g.",
        "bypassing certain distribution windows) could have an impact on Ultimate Revenues, which may accelerate amortization or result in an impairment of capitalized film and television production costs.Given the ongoing uncertainty around live sporting events continuing uninterrupted, the amount and timing of revenues derived from the broadcast of these events may differ from the projections of revenues that support our amortization pattern of the rights costs we pay for these events.",
        "Such changes in revenues could result in an acceleration or slowing of the amortization of our sports rights costs.Revenue RecognitionCertain of our affiliate contracts contain commitments with respect to the content to be aired on our television networks (e.g.",
        "live sports or original content).",
        "If there are delays or cancellations of live sporting events or disruptions to film and television content production activities, we may need to assess the impact on our contractual obligations and adjust the revenue that we recognize related to these contracts.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsGiven the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 across our businesses, the projected cash flows that we use to assess the fair value of our businesses and assets for purposes of impairment testing are subject to greater uncertainty than normal.",
        "If in the future we reduce our estimate of cash flow projections, we may need to impair some of these assets.Prior to the Company’s reorganization in October 2020, the former Direct-to-Consumer & International segment included an International Channels reporting unit, which was comprised of the Company’s international television networks.",
        "Our international television networks primarily derive revenues from affiliate fees charged to MVPDs for the right to deliver our programming under multi-year licensing agreements and the sales of advertising time/space on the networks.In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we assessed the International Channels’ long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and recorded impairments of $1.9 billion primarily related to MVPD agreement intangible assets and $3.1 billion related to goodwill.As of October 2, 2021, the remaining balance of our international MVPD agreement intangible assets was $2.2 billion, primarily related to our channel businesses in Latin America and India.See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the impairment tests performed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.Risk Management ContractsThe Company employs a variety of financial instruments (derivatives) including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, our projected cash flows or projected usage of commodities are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty, which may cause us to recognize gains or losses on our hedging instruments in different periods than the hedged transaction.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” made by or on behalf of the Company.",
        "We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our 53TABLE OF CONTENTSshareholders.",
        "Such statements may, for example, express expectations, projections, estimates, plans or future impacts; actions that we may take (or not take); developments beyond our control, including changes in domestic or global economic conditions; or other statements that are not historical in nature.",
        "All forward-looking statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance as of the time the statements are made and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update its disclosure relating to forward-looking matters.",
        "Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control.",
        "In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting these expectations, which may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports we file with the SEC, are set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K as well as in this Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Item 1 - Business.ITEM 7A.",
        "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.Policies and ProceduresIn the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs.",
        "To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings.",
        "By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges.",

        "The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures.",
        "The economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes.",
        "The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.It is the Company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above.",
        "The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.Value at Risk (VAR)The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments.",
        "The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation.",
        "The Company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique).",
        "These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end.",

        "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
        "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.",

        "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
        "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.65TABLE OF CONTENTSCritical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
        "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Amortization of Production CostsAs described in Note 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements and disclosed by management, capitalized film and television production costs are amortized based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group.",
        "Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually is amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",
        "For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used by the Company’s DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films.",
        "For episodic television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on the Company’s DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.",
        "Production costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage (which may be, for example, derived from historical viewership patterns), typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
        "For the year ended October 2, 2021, the Company recognized $8,175 million of amortization of produced content costs, which is primarily included in “Cost of services” in the consolidated statements of operations.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of production costs is a critical audit matter are the significant auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence used in the amortization calculation for production costs monetized individually and as a group, and management’s estimates of Ultimate Revenues and projected usage.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
        "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to amortization of production costs, including controls over the estimation of Ultimate Revenues and projected usage.",
        "These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining the amortization of production costs, (ii) evaluating whether ultimate revenues for certain content titles were reasonable considering information such as past performance of comparable titles, future firm commitments to license programs, and current market trends, (iii) evaluating the accelerated amortization pattern for content predominately monetized as a group, and (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the amortization calculation for certain titles and for historical viewership data used to calculate the estimate of projected usage for certain groups./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPLos Angeles, CaliforniaNovember 24, 2021 We have served as

information as a result of the media and entertainment reorganization).",
        "On March 20, 2019, the Company acquired Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., a diversified global media and entertainment company, which was subsequently renamed TFCF Corporation (TFCF).",

        "These operations resumed, generally at reduced capacity, at various points since May 2020.",
        "We have delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases, and stage play performances were suspended as of March 2020.",

        "Although film and television production generally resumed beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we continue to see disruption of production activities depending on local circumstances.",
        "Fewer theatrical releases and production delays have limited the availability of film content to be sold in distribution windows subsequent to the theatrical release.The impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, the impact of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.",
        "We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.In fiscal 2020, the Company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairments totaling $5.0 billion, in part due to the negative impact COVID-19 has had on the International Channels business (see Note 19).DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSDisney Media and Entertainment DistributionThe DMED segment encompasses the Company’s global film and episodic television content production and distributionactivities.",

        "This change did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements for fiscal year 2020.Capitalized content cost, whether produced or acquired/licensed rights are recognized as “Produced and licensed content costs” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",
        "Advances for live programming rights made prior to the live event are reported in “Content advances” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

        "theatrical revenues or sales to third-party television programmers).80TABLE OF CONTENTS•Group - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g.",
        "subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network).The determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at commencement of production on a consolidated basis and is based on the means by which we derive third-party revenues from use of the content.",
        "Imputed title by title license fees that may be necessary for other purposes and are established as required by those purposes.We generally classify content that is initially intended for use on our DTC streaming services or Linear Networks as group assets.",
        "Content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees, we generally classify as individual assets.",
        "Because the new accounting guidance is applied prospectively, the predominant monetization strategy for content released prior to the beginning of fiscal 2020 was determined based on the expected means of monetization over the remaining life of the content.",
        "Thus for example, film titles that were released theatrically and in home entertainment prior to fiscal year 2020 and are now distributed on Disney+ are generally considered group content.The classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title’s monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g.",
        "content that was initially intended for license to a third-party is instead used on an owned DTC service).",
        "When there is a significant change in monetization strategy, the title’s capitalized content costs are tested for impairment.Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually is amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",
        "For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films.",
        "For episodic television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.",
        "Participations and residuals are expensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.Production costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage (which may be, for example, derived from historical viewership patterns), typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
        "Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.Licensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our Linear Networks or DTC streaming services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate.",
        "We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement.",
        "If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.Acquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition.",
        "Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, except it excludes the prior seasons of episodic television programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.The costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments.",
        "For content that is predominantly monetized individually, the unamortized costs are compared to the estimated fair value.",
        "The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the cash flows directly attributable to the title.",
        "To the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.",
        "For content that is predominantly monetized as a group, the aggregate unamortized costs of the group are compared to the present value of the discounted cash flows using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content.",
        "If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group.",
        "If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written-off immediately.",
        "Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of assessing recoverability.Internal-Use Software CostsThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training.",
        "Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended.",
        "As of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled $1,186 million and $778 million, respectively.",

        "The most significant change requires lessees to record the present value of operating lease payments as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.",
        "We adopted the new guidance using the modified retrospective method at the beginning of fiscal year 2020, therefore reporting periods beginning after September 29, 2019 are presented under the new guidance, while prior periods continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting.We determine whether a contract is a lease at contract inception or for a modified contract at the modification date.",
        "At inception or modification, the Company calculates the present value of operating lease payments using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease, which is determined by estimating what it would cost the Company to borrow a collateralized amount equal to the total lease payments over the lease term based on the contractual terms of the lease and the location of the leased asset.",
        "Our leases may require us to make fixed rental payments, variable lease payments based on usage or sales and fixed non-lease costs relating to the leased asset.",
        "Variable lease payments are generally not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability.",
        "Fixed non-lease costs, for example common-area maintenance costs, are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived AssetsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
        "The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
        "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
        "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2021, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
        "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
        "We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
        "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
        "In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.",
        "We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.",
        "If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
        "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.82TABLE OF CONTENTSThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows.The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.",
        "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
        "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.",
        "The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our FCC licenses and trademarks, which are our most significant indefinite-lived intangible assets.Finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods up to 40 years.",
        "The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
        "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
        "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the relevant useful life of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses.",
        "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long lived-assets and the carrying amount of the group’s long-lived assets.",
        "The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying amount of each asset is above its fair value.",
        "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
        "The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.3 billion, $5.2 billion, and $0.6 billion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.The fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of MVPD agreement intangibles assets ($1.9 billion) and goodwill ($3.1 billion) at the International Channels business.",

        "The Company primarily enters into two types of derivatives: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure.",
        "Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment.",
        "Hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g.",
        "forecasted revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g.",
        "floating-rate debt).The Company designates and assigns the derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities.",
        "When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged occur or are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated derivatives.83TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company’s hedge positions are measured at fair value on the balance sheet.",
        "Realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged.",
        "The Company accrues the differential for interest rate swaps to be paid or received under the agreements as interest rates change as adjustments to interest expense over the lives of the swaps.",
        "Gains and losses on the termination of effective swap agreements, prior to their original maturity, are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying hedged transactions.The Company enters into derivatives that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting.",
        "These derivatives are intended to offset certain economic exposures of the Company and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings.",
        "Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under the same category as the cash flows from the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions (see Notes 9 and 18).Income TaxesDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded with respect to temporary differences in the accounting treatment of items for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes.",
        "Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount that, in management’s judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.A tax position must meet a minimum probability threshold before a financial statement benefit is recognized.",
        "The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.",
        "The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsThe Company consolidates the results of certain subsidiaries that are less than 100% owned and for which the noncontrolling interest shareholders have the rights to require the Company to purchase their interests in these subsidiaries.",
        "The most significant of these are Hulu and BAMTech LLC (BAMTech).Hulu provides DTC streaming services and is owned 67% by the Company and 33% by NBCU.",

        "A majority of the operations in this reporting unit were acquired in the TFCF acquisition, and therefore the fair value of these businesses approximated the carrying value at the date of the acquisition of TFCF.The International Channels business has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in decreased viewership and lower advertising revenue related to the availability of content, including the deferral of certain live sporting events.",
        "The Company’s increased focus on DTC distribution in international markets is expected to negatively impact the International Channels business as we shift the primary means of monetizing our film and television content from licensing of linear channels to distributing it on our DTC platforms.",
        "The International Channels reporting unit valuation does not include the value derived from this shift, which is reflected in other reporting units.",
        "In addition, the industry shift to DTC, including by us and many of our distributors, who are pursuing their own DTC strategies, has changed the competitive dynamics for the International Channels business and resulted in unfavorable renewal terms for certain of our distribution agreements.Due to these circumstances, in fiscal 2020, we tested the International Channels’ goodwill and long-lived assets (including intangible assets) for impairment.We determined the appropriate asset groups for our International Channels to be the regions in which they operate.",
        "We estimated the projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the significant assets of the asset group.",
        "If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group’s long-lived assets.We tested the International Channels reporting unit goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the International Channels reporting unit to its carrying value.The more significant inputs used in determining our estimate of the projected undiscounted cash flows included future revenue growth and projected margins as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of the future cash flows (fair value).",
        "The determination of fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates about how market participants would value the business or asset group.",
        "Given the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, the projected cash flows and underlying assumptions are subject to greater uncertainty than normal.In fiscal 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge primarily on our MVPD agreement intangible assets of $1.9 billion and we recorded a $3.1 billion non-cash impairment charge to fully impair the International Channels reporting unit goodwill.",
        "These charges are recorded in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.As of October 2, 2021, the remaining balance of our international MVPD agreement intangible assets was $2.2 billion, primarily related to our channel businesses in Latin America and India.TFCF IntegrationIn fiscal 2019, the Company implemented a restructuring and integration plan as a part of its initiative to realize cost synergies from the acquisition of TFCF, which was substantially complete as of the end of fiscal 2020.",

        "The new guidance requires the allowance for credit losses to be measured based on expected losses over the life of the asset rather than incurred losses.",
        "The Company adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 without restating prior periods by recording the impact of adoption as an adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal 2021.",
        "The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate ReformIn March 2020, the FASB issued guidance which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying current GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the transition from the use of LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.",
        "We are currently evaluating our contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR and the potential effects of adopting this new guidance.",
        "The guidance can be adopted immediately and is applicable to contracts entered into before January 1, 2023.Simplifying the Accounting for Income TaxesIn December 2019, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies the accounting for income taxes.",
        "The guidance amends the rules for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod tax allocations and calculating income taxes in interim periods.",
        "It also reduces complexity in certain areas, including the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group.",
        "The guidance is effective at the beginning of the Company’s 2022 fiscal year. The new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements.117"

        "COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread has impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at the DPEP segment where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended.",
        "These operations resumed, generally at reduced capacity, at various points since May 2020.",
        "We have delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases, and stage play performances were suspended as of March 2020.",
        "Stage play operations resumed, generally at reduced capacity, in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Theaters have been subject to capacity limitations and shifting government mandates or guidance regarding COVID-19 restrictions.",
        "We experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content, including the delay of key live sports programming during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, as well as the suspension of most film and television production in March 2020.",
        "Although film and television production generally resumed beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we continue to see disruption of production activities depending on local circumstances.",
        "Fewer theatrical releases and production delays have limited the availability of film content to be sold in distribution windows subsequent to the theatrical release.We have taken a number of mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses.",
        "We significantly increased cash balances through the issuance of senior notes in March and May 2020.",
        "The Company did not pay a dividend with respect to fiscal 2020 operations and has not declared or paid a dividend with respect to fiscal 2021 operations; suspended certain capital projects; reduced certain discretionary expenditures (such as spending on marketing); reduced management compensation for several months in fiscal 2020 and temporarily eliminated Board of Director retainers and committee fees in fiscal 2020.",
        "In addition, we furloughed over 120,000 of our employees (who continued to receive Company provided medical benefits), most of which have returned from furlough as operations have reopened.",
        "At the end of fiscal 2020, the Company announced a workforce reduction plan, which was essentially completed in the first half of fiscal 2021.",
        "We may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; reducing, or not making, certain payments, such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans; further suspending capital spending, reducing film and television content investments; or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force; or modifying our operating strategies.",
        "Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our businesses.The most significant impact on operating income since the second quarter of fiscal 2020 from COVID-19 was at the DPEP segment due to revenue lost as a result of closures and/or reduced operating capacities.",
        "Although results improved in the second half of fiscal 2021 compared to the second half of fiscal 2020 from reopening our DPEP businesses, we continue to be impacted by reduced operating capacities.",
        "COVID-19 also had a negative impact in fiscal 2021 at our DMED segment compared to fiscal 2020 as higher advertising revenue from the return of live sporting events was more than offset by higher sports programming costs.",
        "Our other film and television distribution businesses were impacted by revenue lost from the deferral or cancellation of significant film releases, partially offset by costs avoided due to a reduction in film cost amortization, marketing and distribution costs.",
        "The impact of COVID-19 on fiscal 2021 and 2020 results is not necessarily indicative of the impact on future period results.32TABLE OF CONTENTSThe impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.Our businesses have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.",
        "For example, when we reopened theme parks and retail stores, we incurred and will continue to incur costs for such things as additional custodial services, personal protection equipment, temperature screenings and testing, sanitizer and cleaning supplies and signage, among other items.",
        "Similar costs have been incurred in the production of film and television content, including live sporting events, and productions may take longer to complete.",
        "The timing, duration and extent of these costs will depend on the timing and scope of the resumption of our operations. These costs totaled approximately $1 billion in fiscal 2021.",
        "Some of these costs have been capitalized and will be amortized over future periods.",
        "With the unknown duration of COVID-19, it is not possible to precisely estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our operations in future periods, although we estimate a modestly lower impact in fiscal 2022.",
        "In addition, we are no longer benefiting from certain savings related to the closure of certain businesses, such as related furloughs.",
        "The reopening or closure of our businesses is dependent on applicable government requirements, which vary by location and are subject to ongoing changes.Additionally, see Part I., Item 1A.",
        "Risk Factors - The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.Direct-to-ConsumerThe Company has significantly increased its focus on distribution of branded film and episodic content via our own DTC streaming services.",
        "As a result, we are forgoing certain licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties in TV/SVOD markets.",
        "We also expect to forgo revenue as we shut down channels in certain markets as a result of investment in our DTC offerings.",
        "In addition, we are increasing programming and production investments to create exclusive content for our DTC offerings.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMSThe Company’s fiscal year end is on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year.",
        "Fiscal 2020 was a fifty-three week year, which began on September 29, 2019 and ended on October 3, 2020.",
        "We estimate that the additional week of operations in fiscal 2020 resulted in a benefit to pre-tax income in the prior year of approximately $200 million, primarily at the DMED segment.Revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 3%, or $2.0 billion, to $67.4 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased $4.9 billion, to income of $2.0 billion; and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Disney increased to income of $1.11 compared to a loss of $1.57 in the prior year.",
        "The EPS increase for the year was due to the comparison to goodwill and intangible asset impairments recognized in the prior year at our International Channels business, an income tax benefit in the current year compared to tax expense in the prior year and lower amortization of fair value step-up on film and television costs and intangible assets from the TFCF acquisition and consolidation of Hulu (collectively TFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization).",
        "These increases were partially offset by lower net investment gains and a decrease in segment operating income at DMED.RevenuesService revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 4%, or $2.5 billion, to $61.8 billion, due to higher DTC subscription revenue, advertising revenue growth and, to a lesser extent, increased merchandise licensing revenue.",
        "These increases were partially offset by a decrease in TV/SVOD distribution revenue, lower theatrical revenues, a decrease in revenue at our parks and experiences businesses and, to a lesser extent, lower electronic home entertainment sales, all of which reflected the impact of COVID-19.",
        "The decrease at parks and experiences was due to lower volumes from closure/generally reduced operating capacities, partially offset by an increase in average guest spending.",
        "The decrease in TV/SVOD distribution revenue also reflected the shift from licensing our content to third parties to distributing it on our DTC streaming services.Product revenues for fiscal 2021 decreased 8%, or $0.5 billion, to $5.7 billion, due to lower home entertainment volumes and a decrease in merchandise, food and beverage sales at parks and experiences as lower volumes were partially offset by an increase in average guest spending.Costs and expensesCost of services for fiscal 2021 increased 4%, or $1.7 billion, to $41.1 billion, due to higher programming, production and technology costs at Disney+ and Hulu and higher sports programming costs.",
        "The increase in sports programming costs was due to NBA, cricket, college football and soccer events, many of which shifted from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19.",
        "These increases were partially offset by a decrease in film and television production cost amortization and distribution costs at 33TABLE OF CONTENTSContent Sales/Licensing reflecting lower revenues and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes at our parks and experiences businesses.Cost of products for fiscal 2021 decreased 11%, or $0.5 billion, to $4.0 billion, due to lower merchandise, food and beverage sales at our theme parks and resorts and a decrease in home entertainment volumes.Selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2021 increased 9%, or $1.1 billion, to $13.5 billion, due to higher marketing costs at Direct-to-Consumer and Linear Networks, partially offset by lower marketing costs at Content Sales/Licensing.Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 4%, or $0.2 billion, to $5.1 billion due to lower amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of TFCF and Hulu and lower depreciation at our theme parks and resorts.Restructuring and Impairment ChargesRestructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2021 were $0.7 billion due to $0.4 billion of asset impairments and severance costs related to the shut-down of an animation studio and the closure of a substantial number of Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe and $0.3 billion of severance and other costs in connection with the integration of TFCF and workforce reductions at DPEP.",

        "For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group.",
        "See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).With respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance.",
        "Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance.",
        "Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort.",
        "Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms.",
        "Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year.",
        "If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment.",
        "Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
        "The determination of projected usage requires judgement and is reviewed periodically for changes.",
        "If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue (relative value).",
        "If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.",
        "If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.50TABLE OF CONTENTSRevenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business.",
        "Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions.",
        "Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually.",
        "Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date.",
        "A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate.",
        "We increased our discount rate to 2.88% at the end of fiscal 2021 from 2.82% at the end of fiscal 2020 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2021 year-end measurement date.",
        "The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves.",
        "A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2022 by approximately $341 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 2, 2021 by approximately $4.0 billion.",
        "A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $292 million and $3.4 billion, respectively.To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class.",
        "Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense.",
        "A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2022 annual expense by approximately $175 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
        "The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
        "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
        "The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.",
        "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2021, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
        "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
        "We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
        "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
        "In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.",
        "We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.",
        "If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
        "51TABLE OF CONTENTSThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows.",
        "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.",
        "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
        "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
        "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
        "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses.",
        "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
        "Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.The Company has investments in equity securities.",
        "For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments.",
        "If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.3 billion and $5.2 billion in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.",
        "The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.The fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of MVPD agreement intangible assets ($1.9 billion) and goodwill ($3.1 billion) at the International Channels’ business.",
        "See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these impairment charges.Allowance for Credit LossesWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.",
        "In times of economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods.",
        "If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.",
        "See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings.",
        "These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate.",
        "From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss.",
        "It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters.",
        "See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income TaxAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.",
        "From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments.",
        "Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities.",
        "The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to 52TABLE OF CONTENTSsettle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.Impacts of COVID-19 on Accounting Policies and EstimatesIn light of the currently unknown ultimate duration and severity of COVID-19, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply our significant accounting policies and make changes to these estimates and judgements over time.",
        "This could result in meaningful impacts to our financial statements in future periods.",
        "A more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on the Accounting Policies and Estimates follows.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsCertain of our completed or in progress film and television productions have had their initial release dates delayed.",
        "The duration of the delay, market conditions when we release the content, or a change in our release strategy (e.g.",
        "bypassing certain distribution windows) could have an impact on Ultimate Revenues, which may accelerate amortization or result in an impairment of capitalized film and television production costs.Given the ongoing uncertainty around live sporting events continuing uninterrupted, the amount and timing of revenues derived from the broadcast of these events may differ from the projections of revenues that support our amortization pattern of the rights costs we pay for these events.",
        "Such changes in revenues could result in an acceleration or slowing of the amortization of our sports rights costs.Revenue RecognitionCertain of our affiliate contracts contain commitments with respect to the content to be aired on our television networks (e.g.",
        "live sports or original content).",
        "If there are delays or cancellations of live sporting events or disruptions to film and television content production activities, we may need to assess the impact on our contractual obligations and adjust the revenue that we recognize related to these contracts.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsGiven the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 across our businesses, the projected cash flows that we use to assess the fair value of our businesses and assets for purposes of impairment testing are subject to greater uncertainty than normal.",
        "If in the future we reduce our estimate of cash flow projections, we may need to impair some of these assets.Prior to the Company’s reorganization in October 2020, the former Direct-to-Consumer & International segment included an International Channels reporting unit, which was comprised of the Company’s international television networks.",
        "Our international television networks primarily derive revenues from affiliate fees charged to MVPDs for the right to deliver our programming under multi-year licensing agreements and the sales of advertising time/space on the networks.In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we assessed the International Channels’ long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and recorded impairments of $1.9 billion primarily related to MVPD agreement intangible assets and $3.1 billion related to goodwill.As of October 2, 2021, the remaining balance of our international MVPD agreement intangible assets was $2.2 billion, primarily related to our channel businesses in Latin America and India.See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the impairment tests performed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.Risk Management ContractsThe Company employs a variety of financial instruments (derivatives) including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, our projected cash flows or projected usage of commodities are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty, which may cause us to recognize gains or losses on our hedging instruments in different periods than the hedged transaction.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” made by or on behalf of the Company.",
        "We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our 53TABLE OF CONTENTSshareholders.",
        "Such statements may, for example, express expectations, projections, estimates, plans or future impacts; actions that we may take (or not take); developments beyond our control, including changes in domestic or global economic conditions; or other statements that are not historical in nature.",
        "All forward-looking statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance as of the time the statements are made and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update its disclosure relating to forward-looking matters.",
        "Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control.",
        "In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting these expectations, which may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports we file with the SEC, are set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K as well as in this Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Item 1 - Business."

        "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.Policies and ProceduresIn the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs.",
        "To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings.",
        "By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges.",

        "Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.",
        "By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years.",
        "The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures.",
        "The economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes.",
        "The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.It is the Company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above.",
        "The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.Value at Risk (VAR)The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments.",
        "The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation.",
        "The Company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique).",
        "These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end.",
        "The model includes all of the Company’s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments.",

        "federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.",
        "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
        "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",

        "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
        "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.65TABLE OF CONTENTSCritical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
        "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Amortization of Production CostsAs described in Note 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements and disclosed by management, capitalized film and television production costs are amortized based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group.",
        "Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually is amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",
        "For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used by the Company’s DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films.",
        "For episodic television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on the Company’s DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.",
        "Production costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage (which may be, for example, derived from historical viewership patterns), typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
        "For the year ended October 2, 2021, the Company recognized $8,175 million of amortization of produced content costs, which is primarily included in “Cost of services” in the consolidated statements of operations.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of production costs is a critical audit matter are the significant auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence used in the amortization calculation for production costs monetized individually and as a group, and management’s estimates of Ultimate Revenues and projected usage.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
        "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to amortization of production costs, including controls over the estimation of Ultimate Revenues and projected usage.",
        "These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining the amortization of production costs, (ii) evaluating whether ultimate revenues for certain content titles were reasonable considering information such as past performance of comparable titles, future firm commitments to license programs, and current market trends, (iii) evaluating the accelerated amortization pattern for content predominately monetized as a group, and (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the amortization calculation for certain titles and for historical viewership data used to calculate the estimate of projected usage for certain groups./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPLos Angeles, CaliforniaNovember 24, 2021 We have served as

        "This change did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements for fiscal year 2020.Capitalized content cost, whether produced or acquired/licensed rights are recognized as “Produced and licensed content costs” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",
        "Advances for live programming rights made prior to the live event are reported in “Content advances” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

        "theatrical revenues or sales to third-party television programmers).80TABLE OF CONTENTS•Group - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g.",
        "subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network).The determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at commencement of production on a consolidated basis and is based on the means by which we derive third-party revenues from use of the content.",
        "Imputed title by title license fees that may be necessary for other purposes and are established as required by those purposes.We generally classify content that is initially intended for use on our DTC streaming services or Linear Networks as group assets.",
        "Content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees, we generally classify as individual assets.",
        "Because the new accounting guidance is applied prospectively, the predominant monetization strategy for content released prior to the beginning of fiscal 2020 was determined based on the expected means of monetization over the remaining life of the content.",
        "Thus for example, film titles that were released theatrically and in home entertainment prior to fiscal year 2020 and are now distributed on Disney+ are generally considered group content.The classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title’s monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g.",
        "content that was initially intended for license to a third-party is instead used on an owned DTC service).",
        "When there is a significant change in monetization strategy, the title’s capitalized content costs are tested for impairment.Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually is amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",
        "For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films.",
        "For episodic television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.",
        "Participations and residuals are expensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.Production costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage (which may be, for example, derived from historical viewership patterns), typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
        "Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.Licensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our Linear Networks or DTC streaming services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate.",
        "We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement.",
        "If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.Acquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition.",
        "Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, except it excludes the prior seasons of episodic television programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.The costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments.",
        "For content that is predominantly monetized individually, the unamortized costs are compared to the estimated fair value.",
        "The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the cash flows directly attributable to the title.",
        "To the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.",
        "For content that is predominantly monetized as a group, the aggregate unamortized costs of the group are compared to the present value of the discounted cash flows using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content.",
        "If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group.",
        "If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written-off immediately.",
        "Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of assessing recoverability.Internal-Use Software CostsThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training.",
        "Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended.",
        "As of October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled $1,186 million and $778 million, respectively.",

        "The most significant change requires lessees to record the present value of operating lease payments as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.",
        "We adopted the new guidance using the modified retrospective method at the beginning of fiscal year 2020, therefore reporting periods beginning after September 29, 2019 are presented under the new guidance, while prior periods continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting.We determine whether a contract is a lease at contract inception or for a modified contract at the modification date.",
        "At inception or modification, the Company calculates the present value of operating lease payments using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease, which is determined by estimating what it would cost the Company to borrow a collateralized amount equal to the total lease payments over the lease term based on the contractual terms of the lease and the location of the leased asset.",
        "Our leases may require us to make fixed rental payments, variable lease payments based on usage or sales and fixed non-lease costs relating to the leased asset.",
        "Variable lease payments are generally not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability.",
        "Fixed non-lease costs, for example common-area maintenance costs, are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived AssetsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
        "The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
        "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
        "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2021, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
        "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units.",
        "We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
        "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.",
        "In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.",
        "We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.",
        "If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value.",
        "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
        "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.82TABLE OF CONTENTSThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows.The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.",
        "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
        "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.",
        "The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our FCC licenses and trademarks, which are our most significant indefinite-lived intangible assets.Finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods up to 40 years.",
        "The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
        "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
        "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the relevant useful life of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
        "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses.",
        "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long lived-assets and the carrying amount of the group’s long-lived assets.",
        "The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying amount of each asset is above its fair value.",
        "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
        "The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.3 billion, $5.2 billion, and $0.6 billion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.The fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of MVPD agreement intangibles assets ($1.9 billion) and goodwill ($3.1 billion) at the International Channels business.",

        "The Company primarily enters into two types of derivatives: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure.",
        "Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment.",
        "Hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g.",
        "forecasted revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g.",
        "floating-rate debt).The Company designates and assigns the derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities.",
        "When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged occur or are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated derivatives.83TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company’s hedge positions are measured at fair value on the balance sheet.",
        "Realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged.",
        "The Company accrues the differential for interest rate swaps to be paid or received under the agreements as interest rates change as adjustments to interest expense over the lives of the swaps.",
        "Gains and losses on the termination of effective swap agreements, prior to their original maturity, are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying hedged transactions.The Company enters into derivatives that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting.",
        "These derivatives are intended to offset certain economic exposures of the Company and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings.",
        "Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under the same category as the cash flows from the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions (see Notes 9 and 18).Income TaxesDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded with respect to temporary differences in the accounting treatment of items for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes.",
        "Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount that, in management’s judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.A tax position must meet a minimum probability threshold before a financial statement benefit is recognized.",
        "The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.",
        "The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsThe Company consolidates the results of certain subsidiaries that are less than 100% owned and for which the noncontrolling interest shareholders have the rights to require the Company to purchase their interests in these subsidiaries.",
        "The most significant of these are Hulu and BAMTech LLC (BAMTech).Hulu provides DTC streaming services and is owned 67% by the Company and 33% by NBCU.",
        "In May 2019, the Company entered into a put/call agreement with NBCU that provided the Company with full operational control of Hulu.",
        "Under the agreement, beginning in January 2024, NBCU has the option to require the Company to purchase NBCU’s interest in Hulu and the Company has the option to require NBCU to sell its interest in Hulu to the Company, at a redemption value based on NBCU’s equity ownership percentage of the greater of Hulu’s then equity fair value or a guaranteed floor value of $27.5 billion.NBCU’s interest will generally not be allocated its portion of Hulu’s losses as the redeemable noncontrolling interest is required to be carried at a minimum value.",
        "The minimum value is equal to the fair value as of the May 13, 2019 agreement date accreted to the January 2024 estimated redemption value.",

        "The NHL interest included a right to require the Company to purchase the NHL interest for $350 million in 2021.",
        "In August 2021, the NHL exercised its right and the Company purchased the NHL interest for $350 million in September 2021.MLB has the right to sell its interest to the Company and the Company has the right to buy MLB’s interest starting five years from and ending ten years after the Company’s September 25, 2017 acquisition date of BAMTech at a redemption value equal to the greater of fair value or a guaranteed floor value ($563 million accreting at 8% annually for eight years from the date of acquisition).",
        "The MLB interest is required to be carried at a minimum value equal to its acquisition date fair value accreted to its estimated redemption value through the applicable redemption date.",
        "Therefore, the MLB interest is generally not allocated its portion of BAMTech losses.",
        "As of October 2, 2021, the MLB interest was recorded in the Company’s financial statements at $820 million.Our estimate of the redemption value of noncontrolling interests requires management to make significant judgments with respect to the future value of the noncontrolling interests.",
        "We are accreting the noncontrolling interests of both BAMTech and Hulu to their guaranteed floor values.",
        "If our estimate of the future redemption value increased above either of the guaranteed floor values, we would change our rate of accretion, which would generally increase earnings recorded in “Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests” and thus reduce “Net income (loss) attributable to The Walt Disney Company (Disney)” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.84TABLE OF CONTENTSEarnings Per ShareThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts.",
