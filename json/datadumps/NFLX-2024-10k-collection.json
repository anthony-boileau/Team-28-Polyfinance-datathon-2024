    "See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail. COMPETITIONThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change.",
    "We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers’ leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear TV, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, like social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time.",
    "We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time.",
    "We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.SEASONALITY1Table of ContentsOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing.",
    "Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.",
    "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success.",
    "We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property.",
    "Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service.",
    "We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service.",
    "Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute.",
    "The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary.",
    "Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property.",
    "We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.REGULATIONThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action.",
    "Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours.",
    "In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations.",
    "Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content.",
    "In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country.",
    "In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.HUMAN CAPITAL We view our employees and our culture as key to our success.",
    "As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 13,000 full-time employees.",
    "Of these, approximately 9,000 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,000 (15%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 500 (4%) in Latin America and 1,500 (12%) in Asia-Pacific.",
    "We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year.",
    "We believe a critical component of our success is our company culture.",
    "This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our associates to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of excellence.",
    "We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team.",
    "We empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; each employee has a high degree of freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the company in carrying out their role.",
    "In return, our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions.",
    "With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun, stimulating, creative, collaborative and successful organization.As we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations.",
    "We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us.",
    "We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role.",
    "We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve.",
    "We look to help increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks.",
    "We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities.",

    "We offer programs, such as seminars and lectures, that are designed to equip our leaders (officers, VPs, people managers and director and senior manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic goals.",
    "We have built a portfolio of programs under three foundational pillars - great company, great leaders, and great human beings - which we believe support our current and future success.",
    "We also offer programs and workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring 2Table of Contentsteams.",
    "We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world.We aim to generally pay our employees at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options.",
    "This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences.",
    "We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender (globally) and race (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances.",
    "We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.We care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits.",
    "In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them.",
    "Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.We believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.OTHER INFORMATIONWe maintain a website at www.netflix.com.",

    "We use these channels as well as social media and blogs to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues.",
    "It is possible that the information we post on social media and blogs could be deemed to be material information.",

    "3Table of Contents",
    "Item 1A.Risk FactorsIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.",
    "In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.Risks Related to Our BusinessIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.We must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base.",
    "Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we provide our service.",
    "In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries.",
    "Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games.",
    "Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members.",
    "Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.",
    "Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household expenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved.",
    "Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules.",
    "Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members.",
    "If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted.",
    "If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.",
    "If we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by them, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly, our revenue, including revenue per paying membership, and results of operations may be adversely affected.",
    "We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games.",
    "If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted.",
    "We may also seek to extend our business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we are expanding our offering of consumer products and live experiences.",
    "To the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products and services to help drive growth, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.",
    "We have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself. For example, we introduced a new, lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan.",
    "Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household usage and shared viewing outside of a household.",
    "These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenues per paying membership, revenue and our results of operations.",
    "In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members.",
    "If our efforts to satisfy our existing members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.The market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change.",
    "Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models.",
    "All of these have the potential to capture 4Table of Contentsmeaningful segments of the entertainment video market.",
    "Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings.",
    "Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources.",
    "They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing.",
    "New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video.",
    "In addition, new technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving.",
    "If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies, our ability to compete effectively and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.",
    "Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.",
    "Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free.",
    "In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient.",
    "If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.As a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute.",
    "We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials.",
    "We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series, documentaries, feature films and games.",
    "We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members.",
    "To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted.",
    "As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk.",
    "Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions.",
    "We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.",
    "We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior.",
    "To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise.",
    "We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, is prohibited by law, or could be damaging to our brand or business.To the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer.",
    "Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations.",
    "We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.We are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service, as well as offering live programming and expanding our consumer products and experiences.",
    "We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content, including through acquisitions such as Scanline and Animal Logic.",
    "As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments.",
    "As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our new ad-supported subscription plan, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing, technology and other services.",
    "As we scale our content production, including games, and introduce new features, such as live programming and expand our consumer products and experience offerings, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management attention.",
    "Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers.",
    "As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control.",
    "If we are not able to 5Table of Contentsmanage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our corporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.If we fail to maintain a positive reputation concerning our service and the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, we may face regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.We believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members.",
    "To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted.",
    "To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations.",
    "We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business.",
    "Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted.",
    "There is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, members and other stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, both in the United States and internationally, including the adoption of new disclosure and regulatory frameworks.",
    "To the extent the content we distribute and the manner in which we produce content creates ESG related concerns, our reputation may be harmed.",
    "Our business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.From time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business.",
    "The risks associated with such acquisitions or investments (some of which may be unforeseen) include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to litigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies; and diversion of management’s time and attention, among other acquisition-related risks.We may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business.",
    "In addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated.",
    "Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results.",
    "These fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.We rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.We currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes and mobile devices.",
    "We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the TV set-top boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content providers.",
    "In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service.",
    "If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted.",
    "We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series and films and offer games to other platforms and partners over time.",
    "If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.Our agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service.",
    "Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and our service may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business.",
    "In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices.",
    "If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.6Table of ContentsWe are subject to payment processing risk.Our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing.",
    "We rely on internal systems and those of third parties to process payment.",
    "Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules, regulations, and industry standards, including data storage requirements, additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees.",
    "To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules, regulations or industry standards concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operations could be adversely impacted.",
    "In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf.",
    "If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention.",
    "In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service.",
    "If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines, our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements.",
    "The termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.If government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business.",
    "As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax.",
    "For example, European law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction.",
    "Several jurisdictions have and others may, over time, impose financial and regulatory obligations on us.",
    "In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us.",
    "If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality or requiring payment of network access fees, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business.",
    "Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union.",
    "In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed.",
    "Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.We are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.From time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.",
    "As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us.",
    "These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend.",
    "Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.",
    "We also receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities, and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities.",
    "While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.Our advertising offering is new and subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may adversely affect our business.7Table of Contents We have limited experience and operating history offering advertising on our service, and our advertising revenue may not grow as we expect.",
    "Our ability to generate advertising revenue is subject to various risks and will depend on a number of factors, including:•our ability to attract and retain advertisers; •fluctuations in memberships, including those selecting the ad-supported subscription plan, and member engagement;•the quantity or quality of ads shown to our members;•our ability to compete effectively for advertising spend;•the impact of seasonal, cyclical or other shifts in advertising spend, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions;•the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;•changes in the way advertising on devices, connected TVs or on personal computers is measured or priced;•adverse legal developments relating to advertising or measurement tools;•changes in third-party policies, which may negatively impact the ability to measure, deliver and select ads to be served;•regulatory, legislative and industry developments relating to the collection and use of information and other privacy considerations, including regulations related to ad targeting and measurement tools; •any liability or reputational harm from advertisements shown on our service; •our relationship with third-party service providers for the management, operation, sale and technology to support advertisements on our service; •our ability to develop and expand an advertising sales organization team;•our ability to develop the technology and related infrastructure to support advertising;•the impact of our content and reputation on advertisers’ willingness to spend with us; and •any member dissatisfaction due to advertisements.Risks Related to Intellectual PropertyIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.Our ability to provide our members with content they can enjoy depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including necessary distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute.",
    "The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary.",
    "As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies.",
    "If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase.",
    "Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly.",
    "Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase.",
    "As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content.",
    "We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner.",
    "Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service.",
    "If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.Music and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution.",
    "In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories.",
    "If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business.",
    "Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us.",
    "Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs.",
    "Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to expose us to greater distribution expenses in certain markets.",
    "8Table of ContentsIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights.",

    "The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments.",
    "Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below.",
    "We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.",
    "Actual results may differ from these estimates.Content We acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment.",
    "The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability.",
    "Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense.",
    "Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.We recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.",
    "For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming.",
    "For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.",
    "Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability.",
    "The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization.",
    "On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years 28Table of Contentsafter its month of first availability.",
    "We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis.",
    "Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.In the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions.",
    "The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned.",
    "In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service.",
    "Upon a title’s launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables.",
    "Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level.",
    "Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost.",
    "To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances.",
    "If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value.",
    "In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.",
    "Income TaxesWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.",
    "Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.",
    "The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.",
    "The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.",
    "Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.",
    "The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business.",
    "Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.We do not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes.",
    "We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.",
    "The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.",
    "Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.",

    "Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 57% of revenue and 28% of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023.",

    "Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.",
    "Basis of PresentationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.",
    "Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.",
    "Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities.",
    "The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.",
    "On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates.",
    "Actual results may differ from these estimatesRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis.",
    "Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis.",
    "ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.",
    "The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07.In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction.",
    "ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.",
    "The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.Cash Equivalents and Short-term InvestmentsThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.",
    "The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions that it expects to settle within several days as cash equivalents.",
    "The Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale.",
    "Short-term investments are reported at fair value, with allowances for credit losses included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.",
    "The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.Short-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment.",
    "When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.44Table of ContentsContent The Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment.",
    "The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability.",
    "Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense.",
    "Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.The Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.",
    "For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming.",
    "For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.",
    "Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability.",
    "The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization.",
    "On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability.",
    "The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis.",
    "The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.In the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company's behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions.",
    "The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned.",
    "In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company’s service.",
    "Upon a title’s launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables.",
    "Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of the Company’s content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level.",
    "Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost.",
    "To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances.",
    "If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value.",
    "In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.AcquisitionsThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.",
    "In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.",
    "Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.",
    "Trade ReceivablesTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company's behalf.",
    "The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors.",
    "The Company's allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Revenue RecognitionThe Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees.",
    "Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period.",
    "Revenues are 45Table of Contentspresented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities.",
    "The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"), provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members.",
    "In circumstances in which the price that the member pays is established by a partner and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), the net amount collected from the partner is recognized as revenue.The Company also earns revenue from advertisements presented on its streaming service, consumer products and various other sources.",
    "Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.",
    "See Note 2 Revenue Recognition to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenues.MarketingMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs.",
    "Marketing expenses also include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for personnel that support the Company's sales and marketing activities.",
    "Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.",
    "Advertising expenses were $1,732 million, $1,586 million and $1,669 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",
    "Income TaxesThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.",
    "Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.",
    "The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.",
    "The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.",
    "We account for the tax effects of global intangible low tax income as a current period expense.",
    "The Company does not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes.",
    "The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.",
    "The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.",
    "The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.",
    "See Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.Foreign CurrencyThe functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates.",
    "The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period.",
    "Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period.",
    "Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income\" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period.",
    "Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in \"Interest and other income (expense)\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.",
    "Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of $293 million, a gain of $282 million, and a gain of $403 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.",
    "These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company uses derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary objective of reducing operating income and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.",
    "The Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S.",
    "dollar, as well as the foreign exchange risk on forecasted transactions and firm commitments related to the licensing and production of foreign currency-denominated content assets.",
    "These forward contracts 46Table of Contentsare designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 24 months or less.",
    "The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.The Company recognizes derivative instruments at fair value as either assets (presented in “Other current assets” and “Other non-current assets”) or liabilities (presented in “Accrued expenses and other liabilities'' and “Other non-current liabilities”) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.",
    "The Company classifies derivative instruments in the Level 2 category within the fair value hierarchy.",
    "The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI\") and reclassified into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings.",
    "The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into “Cost of Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized.",
    "Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.",
    "In the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation.See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s derivative financial instruments.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company grants non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis.",

    "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
    "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 26, 202432Table of Contents",

    "Basis of PresentationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.",
    "Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.",
    "Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities.",
    "The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.",
    "On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates.",
    "Actual results may differ from these estimatesRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis.",
    "Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis.",
    "ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.",
    "The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07.In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction.",
    "ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.",
    "The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.Cash Equivalents and Short-term InvestmentsThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.",
    "The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions that it expects to settle within several days as cash equivalents.",
    "The Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale.",
    "Short-term investments are reported at fair value, with allowances for credit losses included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.",
    "The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.Short-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment.",
    "When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.44Table of ContentsContent The Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment.",
    "The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability.",
    "Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense.",
    "Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.The Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.",
    "For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming.",
    "For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.",
    "Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability.",
    "The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization.",
    "On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability.",
    "The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis.",
    "The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.In the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company's behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions.",
    "The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned.",
    "In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company’s service.",
    "Upon a title’s launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables.",
    "Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of the Company’s content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level.",
    "Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost.",
    "To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances.",
    "If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value.",
    "In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.AcquisitionsThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.",
    "In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.",
    "Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.",
    "Trade ReceivablesTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company's behalf.",
    "The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors.",
    "The Company's allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Revenue RecognitionThe Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees.",
    "Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period.",
