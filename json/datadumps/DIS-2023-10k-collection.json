    "For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group.",
    "See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).62TABLE OF CONTENTSWith respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance.",
    "Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance.",
    "Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort.",
    "Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms.",
    "Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year.",
    "If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment.",
    "Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.Production costs classified as individual are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title’s unamortized costs to the present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title.",
    "To the extent the title’s unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
    "The determination of projected usage requires judgment and is reviewed on a regular basis for changes. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change.",
    "Historical viewing patterns are the most significant input into determining the projected usage, and significant judgment is required in using historical viewing patterns to derive projected usage.",
    "If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group.",
    "The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content.",
    "If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group.",
    "If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value.",
    "Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on projections of revenues for each season relative to projections of total revenues over the contract period (estimated relative value).",
    "Projected revenues include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue.",
    "If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.",
    "If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.Revenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business.",
    "Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions.",
    "Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually.",
    "Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date.",
    "A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate.",
    "We increased our discount rate to 5.94% at the end of fiscal 2023 from 5.44% at the end of fiscal 2022 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2023 year-end measurement date.",
    "The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves.",
    "A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2024 by approximately $200 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2023 by approximately $2.0 billion.",
    "A one 63TABLE OF CONTENTSpercentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $45 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class.",
    "Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense.",
    "A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2024 annual expense by approximately $170 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
    "The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
    "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
    "The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.",
    "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2023, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment, under both the previous segment reporting structure and the new segment reporting structure.",
    "There were no goodwill impairments under the previous reporting structure.",
    "The change in reporting structure requires judgment to identify new reporting units, allocate goodwill to these reporting units (based on relative fair values) and assign other recorded assets and liabilities to these reporting units.",
    "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
    "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value.",
    "Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections.",
    "Discount rates for each reporting unit are determined based on the inherent risks of each reporting unit’s underlying operations.",
    "We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.Since our prior annual impairment assessment performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the fair values of our media and entertainment businesses have generally declined as a result of higher discount rates and lower projections for certain revenue streams.Based on our projections, the carrying amounts of our entertainment and international sports linear networks reporting units exceeded their fair values and we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of approximately $0.7 billion.",
    "The entertainment linear networks reporting unit goodwill after impairment is approximately $8 billion and the international sports linear networks reporting unit goodwill is fully impaired.In addition, the fair value of our entertainment DTC services reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by less than 10%.",
    "Goodwill of the entertainment DTC services reporting unit is approximately $45 billion.Significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model relate to future revenues and certain operating expenses, terminal growth rates and discount rates.",
    "Changes to these significant assumptions, market trends, or macroeconomic events could produce test results in the future that differ, and we could be required to record additional impairment charges.",
    "For our entertainment linear networks reporting unit, a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 1% reduction in projected cash flows used to determine fair value would result in an incremental impairment charge of approximately $0.3 billion.For our entertainment DTC services reporting unit, a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate used to determine fair value would result in an impairment of $0.5 billion, and a 1% reduction in projected cash flows would result in a decrease in the excess fair value over carrying amount by approximately $0.9 billion.To test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair 64TABLE OF CONTENTSvalue.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.",
    "The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.",
    "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.",
    "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
    "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
    "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
    "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
    "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses.",
    "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group.",
    "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
    "Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.The Company has investments in equity securities.",
    "For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments.",
    "If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded.",
    "The Company tested its indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $2.3 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",
    "The fiscal 2023 charges primarily related to content impairments resulting from a strategic change in our approach to content curation. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.",
    "The fiscal 2022 charges primarily related to exiting our businesses in Russia.",
    "The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.Allowance for Credit LossesWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.",
    "In times of economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods.",
    "If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.",
    "See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings.",
    "These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate.",
    "From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss.",
    "It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters.",
    "See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income TaxAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.",
    "From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments.",
    "Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities.",
    "The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to 65TABLE OF CONTENTSsettle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.",

    "The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
    "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
    "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.",
    "Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.78TABLE OF CONTENTSREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Walt Disney CompanyOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Walt Disney Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).",
    "We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.",

    "Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.",
    "We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.",
    "federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.",
    "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
    "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",
    "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.",
    "Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.",
    "We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
    "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
    "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, 79TABLE OF CONTENTSsubjective, or complex judgments.",
    "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Annual Goodwill Impairment Assessment – Entertainment Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Services Reporting UnitsAs described in Notes 2 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $77.1 billion as of September 30, 2023, of which a significant portion relates to the entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units.",
    "Management performs the annual test of goodwill for impairment in the fiscal fourth quarter, and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
    "Management bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.",
    "The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.",
    "To determine the fair value of the Company’s reporting units, management generally uses a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
    "Significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model relate to future revenues and certain operating expenses, terminal growth rates, and discount rates.",
    "Based on management’s projections, the carrying amounts of the entertainment and international sports linear networks reporting units exceeded their fair values, and management recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of approximately $0.7 billion, of which a significant portion relates to the entertainment linear networks reporting unit.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the annual goodwill impairment assessment of the entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to future revenues and certain operating expenses, terminal growth rates, and discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
    "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units.",
    "These procedures also included, among others, for the entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow models; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to future revenues and certain operating expenses, terminal growth rates, and discount rates.",
    "Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future revenues and certain operating expenses, and terminal growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the entertainment linear networks and DTC services reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.",
    "Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate assumptions./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPLos Angeles,

    "For purposes of amortization and impairment, the capitalized content costs are classified based on their predominant monetization strategy as follows:•Individual - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are directly attributable to the specific title (e.g.",
    "theatrical revenues or sales to third-party television programmers)•Group - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g.",
    "subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network)The determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at commencement of production on a consolidated basis and is based on the means by which we derive third-party revenues from use of the content.",
    "Imputed title by title license fees that may be necessary for other purposes are established as required for those purposes.We generally classify content that is initially intended for use on our DTC streaming services or Linear Networks as group assets.",
    "We generally classify content initially intended for theatrical release or for sale to third-party licensees as individual assets.",
    "The classification of content as individual or group only changes if there is a significant change to the title’s monetization strategy relative to its initial assessment (e.g.",
    "content that was initially intended for license to a third party is instead used on an owned DTC service).",
    "When there is a significant change in monetization strategy, the title’s capitalized content costs are tested for impairment.Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",
    "For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial release for theatrical films.",
    "For episodic series that are classified as individual, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years, including imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.",
    "Participations and residuals are expensed over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production.Production costs that are predominantly monetized as a group are amortized based on projected usage, generally resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern.",
    "Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change.",
    "Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage.Licensed rights to film and television content and other programs for broadcast on our Linear Networks, domestic ESPN television network, International Sports Channels or DTC streaming services are expensed on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate.",
    "We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement.",
    "If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season.Acquired film and television libraries are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years from the date of acquisition.",
    "Acquired film and television libraries include content that was initially released three years prior to its acquisition, except it excludes the prior seasons of episodic programming still in production at the date of its acquisition.Amortization of capitalized costs for produced and acquired content begins in the month the content is first released, while amortization of capitalized costs for licensed content commences when the license period begins and the content is first aired or available for use on our DTC services.",
    "Amortization of content assets is primarily included in “Cost of services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.",
    "The costs of produced and licensed film and television content are subject to regular recoverability assessments.",
    "Production costs for content that is predominantly monetized individually are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title’s unamortized costs to the estimated present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title.",
    "To the extent the title’s unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.",
    "Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group.",
    "The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content.",
    "If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded 96TABLE OF CONTENTSfor the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group.",

    "Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.Content Production IncentivesThe Company receives tax incentives from U.S.",
    "(state and local) and foreign government agencies to encourage the production of film, episodic and streaming content.",
    "The incentives are largely received as tax credits, which are recognized as a reduction to produced and licensed content costs when there is reasonable assurance of collection (presented as “Produced and licensed content costs” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets), resulting in a reduction to programming and production costs (presented as “Costs of services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income) over the asset’s amortization period.Internal-Use Software CostsThe Company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training.",
    "Capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended.",
    "As of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.",
    "The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 5 years.Parks, Resorts and Other PropertyParks, resorts and other property are carried at historical cost.",
    "Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method, generally over estimated useful lives as follows:Attractions, buildings and improvements20 – 40 yearsFurniture, fixtures and equipment3 – 25 yearsLand improvements20 – 40 yearsLeasehold improvementsLife of lease or asset life if lessLeasesThe Company determines whether a contract is a lease at contract inception or for a modified contract at the modification date.",
    "At inception or modification, the Company calculates the present value of operating lease payments using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease, which is determined by estimating what it would cost the Company to borrow a collateralized amount equal to the total lease payments over the lease term based on the contractual terms of the lease and the location of the leased asset.",
    "Our leases may require us to make fixed rental payments, variable lease payments based on usage or sales and fixed non-lease costs relating to the leased asset.",
    "Variable lease payments are generally not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability.",
    "Fixed non-lease costs, for example common-area maintenance costs, are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-Lived AssetsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis.",
    "The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.",
    "To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
    "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2023, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment (see Note 18).97TABLE OF CONTENTSThe impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill and the determination of fair value of the reporting units.",
    "To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate.",
    "The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value.",
    "Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections.",
    "Discount rates for each reporting unit are determined based on the inherent risks of each reporting unit’s underlying operations.",
    "We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.",
    "If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ.To test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value.",
    "If it is, a quantitative assessment is required.",
    "Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.",
    "If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.",
    "Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.",
    "The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our FCC licenses and trademarks, which are our most significant indefinite-lived intangible assets.Finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 5 to 40 years.",
    "The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",
    "Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale.",
    "The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group.",
    "An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses.",
    "If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group.",
    "For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.",
    "The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $3.0 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",
    "The charges are recorded in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.The fiscal 2023 charges primarily related to content impairments resulting from a strategic change in our approach to content curation ($2.2 billion) and goodwill ($0.7 billion) at our entertainment and international sports linear networks reporting units (see Note 18).The fiscal 2022 charges primarily related to exiting our businesses in Russia.",
    "The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.The Company expects its aggregate annual amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for fiscal 2024 through 2028 to be as follows:2024$1,62720251,53520261,0422027965202889898TABLE OF CONTENTSFinancial Risk Management ContractsIn the normal course of business, the Company employs a variety of financial instruments (derivatives) including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.The Company formally documents all relationships between hedges and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions.",
    "The Company primarily enters into two types of derivatives: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure.",
    "Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment.",
    "Hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g.",
    "forecasted revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g.",
    "floating-rate debt).The Company designates and assigns the derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities.",
    "When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged impact earnings or are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated derivatives.The Company’s hedge positions are measured at fair value on the balance sheet.",
    "Realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged.",
    "The Company accrues the differential for interest rate swaps to be paid or received under the agreements as interest rates change as adjustments to interest expense over the lives of the swaps.",
    "Gains and losses on the termination of effective swap agreements, prior to their original maturity, are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying hedged transactions.The Company enters into derivatives that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting.",
    "These derivatives are intended to offset certain economic exposures of the Company and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings.",
    "Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under the same category as the cash flows from the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions (see Notes 8 and 17).Income TaxesDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded with respect to temporary differences in the accounting treatment of items for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes.",
    "Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount that, in management’s judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.A tax position must meet a minimum probability threshold before a financial statement benefit is recognized.",
    "The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.",
    "The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than zero percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Contributions from Noncontrolling Interest HoldersHulu LLCThe Company consolidates the results of Hulu LLC (Hulu), a DTC streaming service provider, which is owned 67% by the Company and 33% by NBC Universal (NBCU).",
    "In May 2019, the Company entered into a put/call agreement with NBCU that provided the Company with full operational control of Hulu.",
    "Under the agreement, NBCU has the option to require the Company to purchase NBCU’s interest in Hulu (put right) and the Company has the option to require NBCU to sell its interest in Hulu to the Company (call right) at a redemption value based on NBCU’s equity ownership percentage of the greater of Hulu’s equity fair value or a guaranteed floor value of $27.5 billion.",
    "In August 2023, certain provisions under the put/call agreement were amended, including the addition of a November 2023 exercise window for the put/call, which would require assessment of Hulu’s equity fair value as of September 30, 2023.",
    "In November 2023, NBCU exercised its put right and the Company is obligated to pay NBCU the minimum value (approximately $9.2 billion based on the guaranteed floor value, less the unpaid capital call contributions payable by NBCU to the Company of $0.6 billion) within 30 days of exercise of the put.",
    "In accordance with the valuation procedures, Hulu’s equity fair value is not expected to be determined until sometime in calendar 2024.",
    "If Hulu’s equity fair value is determined to be higher than the guaranteed floor value, the Company would be required to pay NBCU’s share of the difference between the equity fair value and the guaranteed floor value at that time.Determining the estimated redemption value requires management to make significant judgments.",
    "To the extent the fair value is deemed to exceed the guaranteed floor value, we would recognize NBCU’s share of the additional amount as a charge to “Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests” and thus reduce “Net income attributable to Disney” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.",
    "99TABLE OF CONTENTSIn addition, the Company will share 50% of its tax benefit from the purchase of NBCU’s interest in Hulu with NBCU, which payments are expected to be made primarily over a 15-year period.At September 30, 2023, NBCU’s interest in Hulu is recorded in the Company’s financial statements at $9.1 billion, which is reported as “Redeemable noncontrolling interest” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.BAMTech LLCIn November 2022, the Company purchased MLB’s 15% redeemable noncontrolling interest in BAMTech LLC (BAMTech), which holds the Company’s domestic DTC sports business, for $900 million (MLB buy-out).",
    "MLB’s interest was recorded in the Company’s financial statements at $828 million prior to the MLB buy-out.",
    "The $72 million difference was recorded as an increase in “Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.During the fiscal year ended 2023, Hearst Corporation (Hearst) contributed $710 million to the domestic DTC sports business, in part to fund its 20% share of the MLB buy-out and in part to fund its share of the domestic DTC sports business’s operating cash requirements, which had been funded by the Company through intercompany loans.Earnings Per ShareThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts.",
    "Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Disney by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.",
    "Diluted EPS is based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year, which is calculated using the treasury-stock method for equity-based awards (Awards).",
    "Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods for which they have an anti-dilutive effect.",
    "Stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period are anti-dilutive and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.A reconciliation of the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding and the number of Awards excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, as they were anti-dilutive, are as follows:202320222021Weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding (basic)1,8281,8221,816Weighted average dilutive impact of Awards2512Weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding (diluted)1,8301,8271,828Awards excluded from diluted earnings per share241543RevenuesThe following table presents our revenues by segment and major source: 2023EntertainmentSportsExperiencesEliminationsTotalAffiliate fees$7,369$10,590$—$(1,084)$16,875Subscription fees16,4201,517——17,937Advertising7,5943,9204—11,518Theme park admissions——10,423—10,423Resort and vacations——7,949—7,949Retail and wholesale sales of merchandise, food and beverage——8,921—8,921Merchandise licensing619—2,509—3,128TV/VOD distribution licensing2,645347——2,992Theatrical distribution licensing3,174———3,174Home entertainment931———931Other1,8837372,743(313)5,050$40,635$17,111$32,549$(1,397)$88,898100TABLE OF CONTENTS2022EntertainmentSportsExperiencesEliminations and OtherTotalAffiliate fees$7,739$10,796$—$(1,010)$17,525Subscription fees14,1781,113——15,291Advertising8,6744,3704—13,048Theme park admissions——8,602—8,602Resort and vacations——6,410—6,410Retail and wholesale sales of merchandise, food and beverage——7,838—7,838Merchandise licensing620—3,349—3,969TV/VOD distribution licensing3,551351—(1,023)2,879Theatrical distribution licensing1,875———1,875Home entertainment1,083———1,083Other1,8496401,882(169)4,202$39,569$17,270$28,085$(2,202)$82,7222021EntertainmentSportsExperiencesEliminationsTotalAffiliate fees$8,043$10,609$—$(892)$17,760Subscription fees11,295725——12,020Advertising8,7053,7204—12,429Theme park admissions——3,848—3,848Resort and vacations——2,701—2,701Retail and wholesale sales of merchandise, food and beverage——4,957—4,957Merchandise licensing603—2,995—3,598TV/VOD distribution licensing4,366429——4,795Theatrical distribution licensing920———920Home entertainment1,297———1,297Other1,2604771,456(100)3,093$36,489$15,960$15,961$(992)$67,418The following table presents our revenues by segment and primary geographical markets:2023EntertainmentSportsExperiencesEliminationsTotalAmericas$31,414$16,000$25,188$(1,397)$71,205Europe5,4753703,688—9,533Asia Pacific3,7467413,673—8,160$40,635$17,111$32,549$(1,397)$88,8982022EntertainmentSportsExperiencesEliminationsTotalAmericas$30,841$15,666$22,890$(1,179)$68,218Europe5,0983963,186—8,680Asia Pacific3,6301,2082,009—6,847$39,569$17,270$28,085$(1,179)83,745Content License Early Termination(1,023)$82,7222021EntertainmentSportsExperiencesEliminationsTotalAmericas28,469$14,533$12,147$(992)$54,157Europe4,8363461,508—6,690Asia Pacific3,1841,0812,306—6,571$36,489$15,960$15,961$(992)$67,418101TABLE OF CONTENTSRevenues recognized in the current and prior year from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous reporting periods primarily relate to revenues earned on TV/VOD licenses for titles made available to the licensee in previous reporting periods.",

    "The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves.",
    "The Company measures service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows.Long-term rate of return on plan assets — The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and alternative investments.",
    "When determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which the Company expects the pension funds to be invested.",

    "The Company’s approach to long-term incentive compensation contemplates awards of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs).",
    "Certain RSUs awarded to senior executives vest based upon the achievement of market or performance conditions (Performance RSUs).Stock options are generally granted with a 10 year term at exercise prices equal to or exceeding the market price at the date of grant and become exercisable ratably over a three-year period from the grant date (exercisable ratably over a four-year period from the grant date for awards granted prior to fiscal 2021).",
    "At the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, options can occasionally extend up to 15 years after date of grant.",
    "RSUs generally vest ratably over three years (four years for grants awarded prior to fiscal 2021) and Performance RSUs generally fully vest after three years, subject to achieving market or performance conditions.",
    "Equity-based award grants generally provide continued vesting, in the event of termination, for employees that reach age 60 or greater, have at least ten years of service and have held the award for at least one year.Each share granted subject to a stock option award reduces the number of shares available under the Company’s stock incentive plans by one share while each share granted subject to a RSU award reduces the number of shares available by two shares.",
    "As of September 30, 2023, the maximum number of shares available for issuance under the Company’s stock incentive plans (assuming all the awards are in the form of stock options) was approximately 93 million shares and the number available for issuance assuming all awards are in the form of RSUs was approximately 44 million shares.",
    "The Company satisfies stock option exercises and vesting of RSUs with newly issued shares.",
    "Stock options and RSUs are generally forfeited by employees who terminate prior to vesting.Each year, generally during the first half of the year, the Company awards stock options and restricted stock units to a broad-based group of management, technology and creative personnel.",
    "The fair value of options is estimated based on the binomial valuation model. The binomial valuation model takes into account variables such as volatility, dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate.",
    "The binomial valuation model also considers the expected exercise multiple (the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average) and the termination rate (the probability of a vested option being canceled due to the termination of the option holder) in computing the value of the option.The weighted average assumptions used in the option-valuation model were as follows:202320222021Risk-free interest rate3.6%1.6%1.2%Expected volatility31%28%30%Dividend yield—%—%0.03%Termination rate5.9%5.8%5.8%Exercise multiple1.98 1.98 1.83 Although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date, changes in the Company’s assumptions may change the value of, and therefore the expense related to, future stock option grants.",
    "The assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the expected volatility and expected exercise multiple.",
    "Increases or decreases in either the expected volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease, respectively.",
    "The volatility assumption considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the Company’s performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions.Compensation expense for RSUs and stock options is recognized ratably over the service period of the award.",
    "Compensation expense for RSUs is based on the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the grant date.",
