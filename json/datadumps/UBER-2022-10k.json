        "ITEM 1. BUSINESSOverviewUber Technologies, Inc.",
        "(“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.",
        "We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”).",
        "We connect consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connect Riders and other consumers (“Eater(s)”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.",
        "Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks.",
        "We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Our SegmentsAs of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight.",
        "Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.MobilityMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis.",
        "Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity.",
        "We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region.",
        "For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products.",
        "We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms.",
        "Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate.",
        "We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates.",
        "At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.DeliveryOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.",
        "We launched our Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network.",
        "For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times.",
        "Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on our platform.",
        "In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”) in an all-stock transaction.",
        "The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The Drizly Group, Inc.",
        "(“Drizly”), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business with Drizly’s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. The acquisition of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination.",
        "For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.FreightWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry.",
        "Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment.",
        "The freight industry is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient.",
        "It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax.",
        "Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments.",
        "It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms.",
        "These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or “dead-head” miles, 4which are miles driven by carriers between shipments.",
        "Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end.",
        "Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.We serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery.",
        "We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.",
        "(“Transplace”) in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand our Uber Freight business through Transplace’s expertise in transportation management. The acquisition of Transplace has been accounted for as a business combination.",
        "For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Platform SynergiesOur PlatformThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.",
        "Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.Massive NetworkOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure.",
        "Our network becomes smarter with every trip.",
        "In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.Leading TechnologyWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies.",
        "Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies.",
        "Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational ExcellenceOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with cities and regulators.Product ExpertiseOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide platform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust.We intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with existing platform users.",
        "Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users.",
        "For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform.",
        "Additionally, for the three months ended December 31, 2021, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 12.6 Trips per month on average, compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered.",
        "We believe that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience.",
        "During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber.",
        "Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings.",
        "Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available in select cities as a subscription offering.",
        "Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers.",
        "We exited 2021 with over 6 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs.",
        "In 2020, we rolled out our “Super App” view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers.",
        "We are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking cross-platform advertising formats.",
        "During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.Competitive EnvironmentWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets.",
        "We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize 5these industries.",
        "As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition.",
        "While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do.",
        "The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:•Mobility.",
        "Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services.",
        "In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.",
        "We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.•Delivery.",
        "Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.",
        "Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.•Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H.",
        "Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.Government RegulationWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment.",
        "Our business is subject to a variety of U.S.",
        "federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation.",
        "These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business.",
        "Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below.MobilityOur platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate.",
        "A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements.",
        "Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business.",
        "Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions.",
        "This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model.",
        "Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (“TNC”) regulations.",
        "These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.",
        "These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform.",
        "For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law.",
        "The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.",
        "Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021.",
        "In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.",
        "Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.",
        "See the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A and “Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.6In addition, many jurisdictions have municipal bodies that adopted and will adopt regulations that govern our business.",
        "For example:•In London, Transport for London (“TfL”) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal.",
        "In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,” including with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes.",
        "We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.•Since April 2019, Mexico City’s Secretaría de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operational requirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data sharing requirement and a requirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services.",
        "Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.•In January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers.",
        "In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.",
        "•In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services.",
        "In December 2018, New York City also established a standard for time and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform.",
        "As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.",
        "Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.See the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.",
        "This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model.As we continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.Data Privacy and ProtectionOur technology platform, and the user data we collect and process to run our business, are an integral part of our business model and, as a result, our compliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to improve platform user experience and build trust.",
        "Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties.",
        "Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements for covered businesses.",
        "U.S.",
        "state, city, and foreign regulators are expected to continue proposing and adopting significant laws impacting the processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November 2020 (effective in January 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.Payments and Financial ServicesMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.",
        "For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).",
        "Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions.",
        "In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform.",
        "We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.AntitrustCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S.",
        "and foreign antitrust and competition laws.",
        "An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as 7the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.",
        "In addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.Intellectual PropertyWe believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate.",
        "Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions.",
        "Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate.",
        "We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive new offerings and technologies.",
        "We continue to develop new technologies to enhance existing offerings and services, and to expand the range of our offerings through research and development (“R&D”) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.SeasonalityMobilityWe typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in North America and Europe.",
        "We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter.",
        "In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns.",
        "We expect that seasonality will eventually return to its historic patterns as recovery from the pandemic continues.DeliveryWe typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations.",
        "In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.Human Capital at UberEmployeesWe are a global company and as of December 31, 2021, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 29,300 employees globally and operations in approximately 72 countries and approximately 10,500 cities around the world.",
        "Our human capital strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.Adapting to a New Way of Working.",
        "In 2021, the ever-evolving COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant impact on our employees and our workforce management strategy and caused us to continually adapt how we work.",
        "As a result of COVID-19, in 2020, we asked that all employees who were able to do so work remotely and while we subsequently announced return to office dates, the dynamic COVID situation disrupted our return to office plans—although many of our offices are open, we have not yet set an updated return to office date.",
        "Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees.",
        "As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and social isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition.",
        "The issues of stress and balance were particularly exacerbated among caregivers of young children.",
        "To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways to support our employees as they navigated this crisis in their personal and professional lives.",
        "We provided 8more attention and flexibility to caregivers by providing resources, tools, and support, and amplified our focus on mental health and well-being.Employee Engagement.",
        "To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and are able to achieve to their highest capability.",
        "We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools.",
        "We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being.",
        "But in 2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month.",
        "We use the results of these regular checks to better understand employees’ needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, and growth opportunities.",
        "For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was created based on employee feedback.",
        "In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operations through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.Employee Development and Retention.",
        "We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, satisfied, and productive.",
        "Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs.",
        "Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the business.",
        "Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promote wellness and productivity.",
        "This helps our diverse employee base manage life’s expected and unexpected events. Globally, Uber offers competitive benefits packages to our employees and their families.",
        "We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.",
        "For additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our 2021 People and Culture Report, which is available on our website.",
        "The information in the 2021 People and Culture report is not a part of this Form 10-K.Diversity and InclusionWe believe that great minds don’t think alike, and we work hard to ensure that people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome and valued.",
        "We encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build.",
        "We believe that when employees feel empowered to succeed in a work environment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows.",
        "To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement processes throughout Uber and measure progress.",
        "For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadership roles come from historically underrepresented groups.Our Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensation packages of our most senior executives.We encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber’s People Team or the Integrity Helpline.As a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially.",
        "To do that, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.",
        "In July 2020, we announced 14 commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have taken action to move these commitments forward.",
        "Some of our commitments to anti-racism include:•Ridding our platform of racism•Fighting racism with technology•Sustaining equity and belonging for all•Driving equity in the communityFor more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2021 People and Culture Report and our 2021 ESG Report, which are available on our website.",
        "The information in these reports is not a part of this Form 10-K.",
        "Driver and Courier Well-BeingIn addition to employees discussed above, our business also depends on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations.In relation to those individuals who earn income on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, providing accessible, flexible work in approximately 72 countries.",
        "Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created 9through its apps.",
        "A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment.",
        "We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work.",
        "Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers.",
        "However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities.",
        "Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive.",
        "The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few.",
        "This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work.",
        "Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.•Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.",

        "Some examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:◦In the United States, European Union, and Canada, we put forward proposals to improve the quality of independent work, calling on policymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work—one where having access to protections and benefits doesn’t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.◦In California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to provide benefits, including healthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.◦In the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward.",
        "Pursuant to this change, drivers who use Uber’s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paid holiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible.",
        "We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an even stronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.•Protections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers, including implementing additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.",

        "“Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Driver Classification DevelopmentsThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad.",
        "We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors.",
        "Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws.",
        "Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction.",
        "In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.",
        "Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020.",
        "Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.In January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied.",
        "The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional.",
        "On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.",
        "We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.Also of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr.",
        "Y. Aslam and Mr. J.",
        "Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent 49contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors.",
        "The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our app was switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016.",
        "The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018.",
        "We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling.",
        "Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK drivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage.",
        "Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring their own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the “worker” classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving with Uber.",
        "They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan.",
        "We have also completed a settlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.",
        "The pension regulator has confirmed that Uber will be required to pay historic company contributions, but that we are not required to pay the driver component of historic pension contributions unless we fail to comply in which case the amount equivalent to those contributions would be payable as a penalty.",
        "We have completed the enrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.",
        "We are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers.",
        "Compensation hearings will take place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands court ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties.",
        "Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform.",

        "As of December 31, 2021, we had $394 million in non-cancelable commitments, with varying expiration terms through December 15, 2026.Critical Accounting EstimatesWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations.",
        "An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements.",
        "We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.",
        "Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.64We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.",
        "For additional information, see the disclosure included in Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products and Delivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users.",
        "Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery.",
        "Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we have no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net).",
        "We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions.",
        "The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives.",
        "We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.",
        "As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver IncentivesWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers.",
        "Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives.",
        "Incentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received.",
        "Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and PromotionsWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform.",
        "Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives.",
        "End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions which are recorded as a reduction of revenue.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.",
        "The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.",
        "Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.",
        "Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and discount rates.Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.",
        "Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.",
        "During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.",
        "Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Embedded DerivativesDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting.",
        "These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value.",
        "These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.",
        "We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public Offering (“QIPO”) conversion option (“QIPO Conversion Option”).",
        "The fair value of these convertible 65notes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPO dates to the valuation date.",
        "The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield, which was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes.",
        "The discount rate is updated during each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.",
        "Upon closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock.",
        "For additional information, refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Investments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt SecuritiesWe hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence.",
        "Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.",
        "Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
        "We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for investments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets.",
        "This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.",
        "In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees’ securities.",
        "In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment.",
        "The impairment analysis for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors.",
        "If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations.",
        "Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost.",
        "In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost.",
        "In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.",
        "The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.",
        "To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.",
        "A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).",
        "Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
        "Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method.",
        "Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost.",
        "Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities’ net income or loss, and the amortization of basis differences.",
        "In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter in arrears.",
        "Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable.",
        "Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential impairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee’s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the investment, among other factors.",
        "If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment.",
        "The fair value determination, particularly for investments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and 66assumptions.",
        "Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment charges.Goodwill Impairment AssessmentWe review goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.",
        "We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.",
        "Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers review financial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit.",
        "To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions.",
        "These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations, or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the ordinary course of business.",
        "Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.",
        "We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.",
        "If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed.",
        "We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.",
        "Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss.",
        "These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and future events.The outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain.",
        "Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions.",
        "We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method.",
        "The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets.",
        "Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates.",
        "The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.",
        "Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain.",
        "Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination.",
        "Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates.",
        "While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different.",
        "We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit.",
        "To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties.",
        "In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us.",
        "We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.67Insurance ReservesWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation.",
        "The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.",
        "The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.",
        "In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.",
        "These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.",
        "Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process.",
        "Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided.",
        "Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments.",
        "As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from the estimated amounts.While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based CompensationWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of our board of directors and non-employees.",
        "The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees.",
        "The majority of our outstanding RSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition.",
        "A small portion of the awards contains service-based vesting condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition.",
        "The service-based vesting condition for the majority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financial and operation metrics.",
        "The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.",
        "We account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period.",
        "We account for forfeitures when they occur.We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date.",
        "The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:•Expected term.",
        "We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.•Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.",
        "Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.•Expected volatility.",
        "We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term.",
        "Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter than the expected term, we consider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.•Expected dividend yield.",
        "Expected dividend yield is zero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.We continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculation on a prospective basis.",
        "As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected term, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.68ITEM 7A.",

        "These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:Interest Rate RiskOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities.",
        "The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements.",
        "A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans.",
        "A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.",
        "A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 million as of December 31, 2021.Investment Risk Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk.",

        "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
        "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of the Company’s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged to end-users for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services.",
        "Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.",
        "This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers.",
        "For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s Mobility and Delivery revenue, net of incentives, was $15.3 billion and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, including incentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether transaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
        "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s revenue recognition process, including controls over the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions.",
        "These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip transaction attributes and assessing management’s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driver statements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue and income statement classification.Valuation of Insurance ReservesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.",
        "The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.",
        "In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.",
        "These reserves are continually reviewed by management and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.",
        "The Company’s short-term and long-term insurance reserves as of December 31, 2021 totaled $4.0 billion.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the actuarial methods and management’s significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs.",
        "The audit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
        "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s valuation of insurance reserves, including controls over the development of the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs.",
        "These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill 72and knowledge to assist in (i) developing, for selected reserve components, an independent actuarial estimate of the insurance reserves, and comparison of this independent estimate to management’s actuarially determined reserves, and (ii) testing, for other selected reserve components, management’s process for estimating the insurance reserves.",
        "Developing the independent estimate involved independently developing the loss development patterns and expected loss costs and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management.",
        "Testing management’s process for estimating the insurance reserves involved evaluating the appropriateness of management’s actuarial methods, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs used in those methods, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Francisco, CaliforniaFebruary 24, 2022We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.73UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts)As of December 31, 2020As of December 31, 2021AssetsCash and cash equivalents$5,647 $4,295 Short-term investments1,180 — Restricted cash and cash equivalents250 631 Accounts receivable, net of allowance of $55 and $51, respectively1,073 2,439 Prepaid expenses and other current assets1,215 1,454 Assets held for sale517 — Total current assets9,882 8,819 Restricted cash and cash equivalents1,494 2,879 Collateral held by insurer860 — Investments (including amortized cost of debt securities of $2,281 and $—)9,052 11,806 Equity method investments1,079 800 Property and equipment, net1,814 1,853 Operating lease right-of-use assets1,274 1,388 Intangible assets, net1,564 2,412 Goodwill6,109 8,420 Other assets124 397 Total assets$33,252 $38,774 Liabilities, redeemable non-controlling interests and equityAccounts payable$235 $860 Short-term insurance reserves1,243 1,442 Operating lease liabilities, current175 185 Accrued and other current liabilities5,112 6,537 Liabilities held for sale100 — Total current liabilities6,865 9,024 Long-term insurance reserves2,223 2,546 Long-term debt, net of current portion7,560 9,276 Operating lease liabilities, non-current1,544 1,644 Other long-term liabilities1,306 935 Total liabilities19,498 23,425 Commitments and contingencies (Note 15)Redeemable non-controlling interests787 204 EquityCommon stock, $0.00001 par value, 5,000,000 shares authorized for both periods, 1,849,794 and 1,949,316 shares issued and outstanding, respectively— — Additional paid-in capital35,931 38,608 Accumulated other comprehensive loss(535)(524)Accumulated deficit(23,130)(23,626)Total Uber Technologies, Inc.",

        "On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities.",

        "The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations and financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration.",

        "While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, additional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives.",

        "Impairment indicators might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities.",
        "If an impairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment.",

        "We adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, on a modified retrospective basis.",
        "Under ASC 326, at each reporting period, we evaluate our available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment).",
        "In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost.",
        "In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.",
        "The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.",
        "To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.",
        "A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).",
        "Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
        "Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected.",
        "Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost.",
        "Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investees’ net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences.",
        "We record our share of the results of equity method investments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations.",
        "We evaluate each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable.",
        "We recognize in the 86consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, any required impairment loss.",
        "Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment.",
        "This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments.Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for ImpairmentWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group (collectively, the “asset group”) may not be recoverable.",
        "We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate.",
        "If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial InstrumentsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.",
        "In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.",
        "The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.",
        "The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below: Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants.",
        "The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.",
        "Refer to Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest EntitiesWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity.",
        "These evaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors.",
        "If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements.",
        "The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE.",
        "Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary.",
        "If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.",
        "Refer to Note 16 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations.",
        "We derive our revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of our platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users.",
        "The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the “Uber Service”).",
        "Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also generate revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services.",
        "Additionally, we derive revenue from customers' use of Freight services.",
        "We periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.87Mobility and Delivery AgreementsWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform.",
        "The MSA defines the service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.",
        "The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction.",
        "A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers’ and Merchants’ ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.In 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets.",
        "In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation to Drivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace.",
        "We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. We present revenue on a net basis for these transactions, as we do not control the service provided by Drivers to end-users.",
        "For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized total revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for delivery services to end-users in those markets.",
        "We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts shall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606.",
        "We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring.",
        "For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-users of $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions.",
        "For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized revenue from end-users of $710 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $2.4 billion associated with these delivery transactions.In all markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users.",
        "As a result, this class of end-users are not our customers.Principal vs. Agent ConsiderationsJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.",
        "We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e.",
        "“gross”), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. “net”).",
        "This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.",
        "For the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions, our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a successful trip or Delivery service to end-users.",
        "We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase or otherwise obtain control of the Drivers’ and Merchants’ goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to perform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.",
        "As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions.",
        "We are not primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services.",
        "While we facilitate setting the price for Mobility and Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does not result in us controlling the services provided to end-users.In the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting end-users seeking Mobility and Delivery services with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services.",
        "Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfully completed transaction with end-users.",
        "Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing the service to Drivers and Merchants.",
        "In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to provide delivery services.",
        "In these markets, we are the principal for the Delivery services and present Delivery revenue on a gross basis because we are primarily responsible for the services.Mobility We derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Riders and successfully complete a trip via the Platform.",
        "We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.",
        "Depending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers.",
        "In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services provided.",
        "Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction.",
        "We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip.88In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips.",
        "On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers.",
        "We generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods.",
        "As we currently have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, we concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.",
        "As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until collected from Drivers.Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products and Vehicle Solutions.DeliveryWe derive our Delivery revenue primarily from service fees paid by Couriers and Merchants for use of the platform and related service to successfully complete a meal delivery service on the platform.",
        "In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.",

        "The pension regulator has confirmed that Uber will be required to pay historic company contributions, but that we are not required to pay the driver component of historic pension contributions unless we fail to comply in which case the amount equivalent to those contributions would be payable as a penalty.",
        "We have completed the enrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.",

        "In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA and revenue growth rates in constant currency, which are described below, to evaluate our business.",
        "We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance.",
        "Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors.",
        "Our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies.",
        "These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.Adjusted EBITDAWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset 61impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses.",
        "Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors.",
        "In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges.",
        "To help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, we are excluding the impacts of COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations from Adjusted EBITDA.",
        "Our board and management find the exclusion of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives from Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it allows us and our investors to assess the impact of these response initiatives on our results of operations.COVID-19 Response InitiativesTo support those whose earning opportunities have been depressed as a result of COVID-19, as well as communities hit hard by the pandemic, we have announced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.",
        "The payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19 and Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment are recorded as a reduction to revenue.",
        "The cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA ReconciliationAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.",
        "These limitations include the following:•Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;•Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;•Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;•Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations;•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net; gain (loss) on business divestitures, net; and unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net; and impairment of debt and equity securities; and•Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.62 The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:Year Ended December 31,(In millions)20202021Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation:Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.$(6,768)$(496)Add (deduct):Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax(20)(74)Provision for (benefit from) income taxes(192)(492)Loss from equity method investments34 37 Interest expense458 483 Other (income) expense, net1,625 (3,292)Depreciation and amortization575 902 Stock-based compensation expense827 1,168 Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements(35)526 Goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets317 157 Acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses86 102 Accelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets102 5 COVID-19 response initiatives106 54 Gain on lease arrangement, net(5)— Restructuring and related charges, net362 — Legacy auto insurance transfer (1)— 103 Mass arbitration fees— 43 Adjusted EBITDA$(2,528)$(774)(1) For further information, refer to Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Constant CurrencyWe compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure.",

        "The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, an increase in our insurance reserves, partially offset by higher accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and lower operating lease liabilities.",

        "The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in our operating lease right-of-use assets, prepaid expenses and other assets and increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by lower accounts payable and operating lease liabilities.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $2.3 billion in acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, $1.1 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $982 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, $297 million in purchases of notes receivable, and $298 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $2.3 billion, proceeds from the sale of equity method investments of $1.0 billion and proceeds from sale of non-marketable equity securities of $500 million.Net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisting of $2.1 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $1.5 billion in acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired and $616 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $1.4 billion.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $1.5 billion of proceeds from issuance of notes, net of issuance cost, $675 million of proceeds from the issuance and sale of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $307 million of principal repayment on the non-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes related to the acquisition of Careem (“Careem Notes”) and $226 million principal payments on finance leases.Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisting of $2.6 billion of proceeds from issuance of notes, net of issuance costs and $247 million of proceeds from issuance of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $891 million of principal repayment on Careem Notes and $527 million of principal repayment on term loan and notes.Other InformationAs of December 31, 2021, $2.2 billion of our $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries.",
        "Cash held outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations.",
        "Repatriation of funds may result in immaterial tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States.",

        "As the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic's impact to us worldwide including our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.Purchase CommitmentsWe have non-cancelable commitments for network and cloud services, background checks, and other items in the ordinary course of business.",
        "These amounts are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated.",
        "As of December 31, 2021, we had $394 million in non-cancelable commitments, with varying expiration terms through December 15, 2026.Critical Accounting EstimatesWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations.",
        "An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements.",
        "We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.",
        "Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.64We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.",
        "For additional information, see the disclosure included in Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products and Delivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users.",
        "Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery.",
        "Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we have no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net).",
        "We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions.",
        "The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives.",
        "We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.",
        "As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver IncentivesWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers.",
        "Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives.",
        "Incentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received.",
        "Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and PromotionsWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform.",
        "Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives.",
        "End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions which are recorded as a reduction of revenue.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.",
        "The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.",
        "Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.",
        "Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and discount rates.Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.",
        "Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.",
        "During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.",
        "Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Embedded DerivativesDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting.",
        "These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value.",
        "These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.",
        "We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public Offering (“QIPO”) conversion option (“QIPO Conversion Option”).",
        "The fair value of these convertible 65notes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPO dates to the valuation date.",
        "The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield, which was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes.",
        "The discount rate is updated during each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.",
        "Upon closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock.",
        "For additional information, refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Investments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt SecuritiesWe hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence.",
        "Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.",
        "Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
        "We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for investments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets.",
        "This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.",
        "In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees’ securities.",
        "In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment.",
        "The impairment analysis for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors.",
        "If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations.",
        "Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost.",
        "In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost.",
        "In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.",
        "The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.",
        "To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.",
        "A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).",
        "Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
        "Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method.",
        "Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost.",
        "Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities’ net income or loss, and the amortization of basis differences.",
        "In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter in arrears.",
        "Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable.",
        "Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential impairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee’s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the investment, among other factors.",
        "If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment.",
        "The fair value determination, particularly for investments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and 66assumptions.",
        "Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment charges.Goodwill Impairment AssessmentWe review goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.",
        "We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.",
        "Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers review financial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit.",
        "To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions.",
        "These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations, or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the ordinary course of business.",
        "Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.",
        "We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.",
        "If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed.",
        "We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.",
        "Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss.",
        "These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and future events.The outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain.",
        "Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions.",
        "We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method.",
        "The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets.",
        "Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates.",
        "The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.",
        "Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain.",
        "Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination.",
        "Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates.",
        "While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different.",
        "We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit.",
        "To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties.",
        "In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us.",
        "We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.67Insurance ReservesWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation.",
        "The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.",
        "The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.",
        "In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.",
        "These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.",
        "Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process.",
        "Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided.",
        "Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments.",
        "As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from the estimated amounts.While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based CompensationWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of our board of directors and non-employees.",
        "The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees.",
        "The majority of our outstanding RSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition.",
        "A small portion of the awards contains service-based vesting condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition.",
        "The service-based vesting condition for the majority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financial and operation metrics.",
        "The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.",
        "We account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period.",
        "We account for forfeitures when they occur.We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date.",
        "The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:•Expected term.",
        "We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.•Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.",
        "Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.•Expected volatility.",
        "We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term.",
        "Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter than the expected term, we consider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.•Expected dividend yield.",
        "Expected dividend yield is zero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.We continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculation on a prospective basis.",
        "As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected term, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.68"

        "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business.",
        "These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:Interest Rate RiskOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities.",
        "The 2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements.",
        "A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans.",
        "A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.",
        "A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 million as of December 31, 2021.Investment Risk Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk.",
        "We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively.",
        "We did not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and cash deposits.",
        "We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk.",
        "Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments.",
        "A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and recently public companies, compared to their fair value.",
        "We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information.",
        "We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.",
        "These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments.",
        "In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering.",
        "As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies.",
        "Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.",
        "We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.",
        "Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.",
        "Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S.",
        "dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.",
        "Foreign currency rates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.",
        "At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.69"

        "Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.",
        "We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.",
        "federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.",
        "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.",
        "Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.",
        "Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.",
        "We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded The Drizly Group, Inc.",
        "(“Drizly”) and Tupelo Parent, Inc.",
        "(“Transplace”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2021.",
        "We have also excluded Drizly and Transplace from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.",
        "Drizly and Transplace are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting collectively represent approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.",
        "A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 71prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.",
        "Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.",
        "The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of the Company’s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged to end-users for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services.",
        "Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.",
        "This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers.",
        "For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s Mobility and Delivery revenue, net of incentives, was $15.3 billion and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, including incentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether transaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
        "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s revenue recognition process, including controls over the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions.",
        "These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip transaction attributes and assessing management’s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driver statements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue and income statement classification.Valuation of Insurance ReservesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.",
        "The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.",
        "In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.",
        "These reserves are continually reviewed by management and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.",
        "The Company’s short-term and long-term insurance reserves as of December 31, 2021 totaled $4.0 billion.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the actuarial methods and management’s significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs.",
        "The audit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",
        "These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s valuation of insurance reserves, including controls over the development of the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs.",
        "These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill 72and knowledge to assist in (i) developing, for selected reserve components, an independent actuarial estimate of the insurance reserves, and comparison of this independent estimate to management’s actuarially determined reserves, and (ii) testing, for other selected reserve components, management’s process for estimating the insurance reserves.",
        "Developing the independent estimate involved independently developing the loss development patterns and expected loss costs and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management.",
        "Testing management’s process for estimating the insurance reserves involved evaluating the appropriateness of management’s actuarial methods, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs used in those methods, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Francisco, CaliforniaFebruary 24, 2022We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.73UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts)As of December 31, 2020As of December 31, 2021AssetsCash and cash equivalents$5,647 $4,295 Short-term investments1,180 — Restricted cash and cash equivalents250 631 Accounts receivable, net of allowance of $55 and $51, respectively1,073 2,439 Prepaid expenses and other current assets1,215 1,454 Assets held for sale517 — Total current assets9,882 8,819 Restricted cash and cash equivalents1,494 2,879 Collateral held by insurer860 — Investments (including amortized cost of debt securities of $2,281 and $—)9,052 11,806 Equity method investments1,079 800 Property and equipment, net1,814 1,853 Operating lease right-of-use assets1,274 1,388 Intangible assets, net1,564 2,412 Goodwill6,109 8,420 Other assets124 397 Total assets$33,252 $38,774 Liabilities, redeemable non-controlling interests and equityAccounts payable$235 $860 Short-term insurance reserves1,243 1,442 Operating lease liabilities, current175 185 Accrued and other current liabilities5,112 6,537 Liabilities held for sale100 — Total current liabilities6,865 9,024 Long-term insurance reserves2,223 2,546 Long-term debt, net of current portion7,560 9,276 Operating lease liabilities, non-current1,544 1,644 Other long-term liabilities1,306 935 Total liabilities19,498 23,425 Commitments and contingencies (Note 15)Redeemable non-controlling interests787 204 EquityCommon stock, $0.00001 par value, 5,000,000 shares authorized for both periods, 1,849,794 and 1,949,316 shares issued and outstanding, respectively— — Additional paid-in capital35,931 38,608 Accumulated other comprehensive loss(535)(524)Accumulated deficit(23,130)(23,626)Total Uber Technologies, Inc.",

        "Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.",
        "Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”).",
        "Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services.",
        "Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks.",
        "Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.",
        "Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).",
        "We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (“VIE”) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary.",
        "Refer to Note 16 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.",
        "All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes.",
        "Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.",
        "On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities.",
        "These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.",
        "We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in particular, our impairment assessment related to the determination of the fair values of certain investments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets.",
        "The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations and financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration.",
        "Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities.",
        "Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.",
        "Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality.",
        "We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented.",
        "Our other receivables primarily consist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims.",
        "We rely on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment service providers”) to collect amounts due from end-users.",
        "Payment service providers are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality.",
        "No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.Certain Significant Risks and UncertaintiesWe have incurred significant net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $23.6 billion as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Our operations have historically been funded through equity and debt financings.",
        "While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, additional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives.",
        "We may not be able to obtain additional 82financing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt instruments.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic.",
        "COVID-19 has rapidly impacted market and economic conditions globally.",
        "In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented, including business activities and travel restrictions, and “shelter-at-home” orders, that have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings.",
        "In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it continues to produce around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows.",
        "The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be further resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users’ behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, commercial paper, U.S.",
        "government and agency securities, and corporate bonds.",
        "We consider all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.",
        "Cash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants, which are included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents Restricted cash and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for certain insurance policies and also include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or contractual restrictions.",
        "Restricted cash and cash equivalents are classified as current and non-current assets based on the contractual or estimated term of the remaining restriction.",
        "The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents to amounts presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows (in millions):As of December 31,201920202021Cash and cash equivalents$10,873 $5,647 $4,295 Restricted cash and cash equivalents - current99 250 631 Restricted cash and cash equivalents - non-current1,095 1,494 2,879 Total cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents$12,067 $7,391 $7,805 Collateral Held by InsurerCollateral held by insurer represents funds held by James River Group companies (“James River”).",
        "These funds, previously held in a trust account, were withdrawn by James River during the fourth quarter of 2019 upon notice of cancellation of their insurance policies (primarily auto insurance policies) issued to one of our subsidiaries.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, the funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary’s current and future claim settlement obligations under the indemnification agreements for these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet.",
        "Accordingly, the amount withdrawn is presented as collateral held by insurer on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.During the third quarter of 2021, in connection with the legacy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned funds, previously presented as collateral held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held.",
        "Accordingly, the funds were reclassified from collateral held by insurer to non-current restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.Legacy Auto Insurance TransferOn September 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance Agreement (the “LPTA”) with James River effective July 1, 2021.",
        "Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary reinsured certain automobile liability insurance risks relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the amount of $345 million (“Premium”).",
        "Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risk transfer arrangements.",
        "In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River will be transferred to a third-party claims administrator for ongoing handling (the “Transferred Claims”) at our expense.",
        "The liabilities associated with the Transferred Claims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021, and adverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities.",
        "During the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $103 million charge in our consolidated statement of operations consisting of the difference between 83the Premium and the assumed liabilities (including the cost of future claims administration), expenses associated with the LPTA, and the adverse development on the Transferred Claims.Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsAccounts receivable represents uncollected payments from end-users for completed transactions where (i) the payment method is credit card and includes (a) end-user payments not yet settled with payment service providers, and (b) end-user payments settled by payment service providers but not yet remitted to us, or (ii) completed shipments where we invoice Freight customers (“Shippers”) and payment has not been received.",
        "The timing of settlement of amounts due from these parties varies by region and by product.",
        "The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities.",
        "Refer to Note 10 – Supplemental Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Merchants.Although we pre-authorize forms of payment to mitigate our exposure, we bear the cost of any accounts receivable losses.",
        "We record an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions.",
        "We consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for fare amounts to be direct and incremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are included as cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.",
        "We estimate the allowance based on historical experience, estimated future payments and geographical trends, which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.",
        "Chargebacks and credit card losses were $195 million, $178 million and $246 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.",
        "Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight‑line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:Property and EquipmentEstimated Useful LifeLandIndefiniteBuildings30-45 yearsSite improvements5-15 yearsLeased vehicles3-10 yearsComputer equipment3-5 yearsFurniture and fixtures3-5 yearsDockless e-bikes3 yearsInternal-use software2 yearsLeased computer equipmentShorter of estimated useful life or lease termLeasehold improvementsShorter of estimated useful life or lease termWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized.",
        "Maintenance and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset’s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred.We capitalize certain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding debt, in developing internal-use software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will function as intended.",
        "Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and begins once the asset is ready for its intended use.",
        "Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred.",
        "In addition, we capitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.Leased vehicle assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.",
        "The vast majority of our leased vehicle assets were reclassified to assets held for sale as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, an agreement was executed with Waydrive Holdings Pte. Ltd.",
        "(“Waydrive”) to purchase the Lion City Rentals Pte. Ltd. (“LCR”), a wholly-owned vehicle solutions subsidiary of ours based in Singapore. Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures for further information.",
        "When leased vehicles are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized.",
        "Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to operating expenses as incurred.84LeasesWe adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method and used the effective date as the date of initial application.",
        "We elected the “package of practical expedients,” which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.",
        "We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.",
        "We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own.",
        "Right of use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.",
        "ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date.",
        "The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable.",
        "The IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis.",
        "Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in our lease liability calculation.",
        "Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs.",
        "Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets.",
        "Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.",
        "For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term.",
        "For finance leases, lease expense is recognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method.",
        "As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, less than 12% of our operating lease ROU assets related to leased assets were outside of the U.S.AcquisitionsWe account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”).",
        "The purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.",
        "The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill.",
        "During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.",
        "Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.",
        "Refer to Note 18 – Business Combinations for further information.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination.",
        "We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired.",
        "We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.",
        "In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.",
        "If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required.",
        "However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill.",
        "If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary.",
        "However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.",
        "Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.Intangible Assets, NetIntangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 18 years.",
        "We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment section.",
        "Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.85InvestmentsEquity SecuritiesAccounting for our equity securities varies depending on the marketability of the security and the type of investment.",
        "Our marketable equity securities in publicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.",
        "Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment.",
        "We reassess at each reporting period to determine whether non-marketable equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.",
        "Non-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.",
        "We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators.",
        "Impairment indicators might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities.",
        "If an impairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment.",
        "We include investments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Debt SecuritiesAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the transaction.",
        "Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially recorded at fair value. Investments in marketable debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equity securities with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities.",
        "Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
        "We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.",
        "As of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet.",
        "Certain investments in non-marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale debt securities were included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt SecuritiesWe account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“ASC 326”).",
        "We adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, on a modified retrospective basis.",
        "Under ASC 326, at each reporting period, we evaluate our available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment).",
        "In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost.",
        "In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors.",
        "The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.",
        "To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.",
        "A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).",
        "Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.",
        "Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected.",
        "Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost.",
        "Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investees’ net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences.",
        "We record our share of the results of equity method investments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations.",
        "We evaluate each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable.",
        "We recognize in the 86consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, any required impairment loss.",
        "Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment.",
        "This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments.Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for ImpairmentWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group (collectively, the “asset group”) may not be recoverable.",
        "We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate.",
        "If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial InstrumentsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.",
        "In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.",
        "The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.",
        "The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below: Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants.",
        "The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.",
        "Refer to Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest EntitiesWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity.",
        "These evaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors.",
        "If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements.",
        "The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE.",
        "Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary.",
        "If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.",
        "Refer to Note 16 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations.",
        "We derive our revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of our platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users.",
        "The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the “Uber Service”).",
        "Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also generate revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services.",
        "Additionally, we derive revenue from customers' use of Freight services.",
        "We periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.87Mobility and Delivery AgreementsWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform.",
        "The MSA defines the service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.",
        "The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction.",
        "A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers’ and Merchants’ ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.In 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets.",
        "In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation to Drivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace.",
        "We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. We present revenue on a net basis for these transactions, as we do not control the service provided by Drivers to end-users.",
        "For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized total revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for delivery services to end-users in those markets.",
        "We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts shall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606.",
        "We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring.",
        "For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-users of $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions.",
        "For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized revenue from end-users of $710 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $2.4 billion associated with these delivery transactions.In all markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users.",
        "As a result, this class of end-users are not our customers.Principal vs. Agent ConsiderationsJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.",
        "We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e.",
        "“gross”), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. “net”).",
        "This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.",
        "For the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions, our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a successful trip or Delivery service to end-users.",
        "We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase or otherwise obtain control of the Drivers’ and Merchants’ goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to perform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.",
        "As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions.",
        "We are not primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services.",
        "While we facilitate setting the price for Mobility and Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does not result in us controlling the services provided to end-users.In the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting end-users seeking Mobility and Delivery services with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services.",
        "Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfully completed transaction with end-users.",
        "Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing the service to Drivers and Merchants.",
        "In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to provide delivery services.",
        "In these markets, we are the principal for the Delivery services and present Delivery revenue on a gross basis because we are primarily responsible for the services.Mobility We derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Riders and successfully complete a trip via the Platform.",
        "We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.",
        "Depending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers.",
        "In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services provided.",
        "Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction.",
        "We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip.88In addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips.",
        "On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers.",
        "We generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods.",
        "As we currently have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, we concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.",
        "As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until collected from Drivers.Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products and Vehicle Solutions.DeliveryWe derive our Delivery revenue primarily from service fees paid by Couriers and Merchants for use of the platform and related service to successfully complete a meal delivery service on the platform.",
        "In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.",
        "We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.In the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price.",
        "The service fee paid by Couriers is the difference between the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers.",
        "End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while we pay Couriers based on time and distance for the delivery.",
        "Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction.",
